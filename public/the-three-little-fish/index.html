<p>Once upon a time, in a little river, lived three colorful fish.  There was a red fish, a blue fish, and a yellow fish. They were the best of friends and always swam together.</p>
<p>One day, the blue fish was swimming near the riverbank and overheard some fishermen talking.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to fish in this river!&rdquo; one fisherman said. &ldquo;Lots of yummy fish swim here! Let&rsquo;s go fishing tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 512; --h: 512;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Three fish, one blue, one yellow, and one red, huddled together in conversation near the riverbank, with a faint image of fishermen and their nets visible in the background." src="/images/image_the-three-little-fish1000000000000000000000000000.png" width="512" height="512">
    </div>

</p>
<p>The blue fish was worried. She quickly swam to her friends and said, &ldquo;Listen! I heard the fishermen. They plan to fish in our river tomorrow! We need to be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red fish said, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s okay! They won&rsquo;t catch me. I&rsquo;m too fast! Besides, we have all the food we need right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue fish said, &ldquo;But we should go somewhere safe, just for one day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yellow fish agreed with the blue fish.  &ldquo;I think we should be careful, even if this is our home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue and yellow fish tried to convince the red fish, but he didn&rsquo;t listen. He was too proud.</p>
<p>The next morning, the fishermen cast their nets and caught many fish – green ones, orange ones, white ones, even some rainbow-colored fish! And guess what? They caught the red fish, too!</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A dramatic illustration of the red fish being caught in a net, with the blue and yellow fish looking on helplessly from a distance, surrounded by the chaos of fishing gear and splashing water." src="/images/image_the-three-little-fish400000.png" width="512" height="512">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great catch!&rdquo; the fishermen cheered.  They hadn&rsquo;t caught so many fish in a long time.</p>
<p>From a safe distance, the blue and yellow fish sadly watched. They were very sorry that their friend, the red fish, had been caught.</p>
<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> We should listen to our friends&rsquo; good advice and not be too proud.</p>
