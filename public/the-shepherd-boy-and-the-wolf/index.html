        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a shepherd boy with slightly messy brown hair and a simple blue tunic, consistently sized and shaped throughout the image. He is depicted in three distinct scenes: 1) happily shouting &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rdquo; atop a gently sloping green hill with a small flock of white sheep, villagers in the background running up the hill, their clothes in warm earth tones; 2) crying next to a scattered group of dead sheep, his sheep in shades of grey and white, while villagers, in the same consistent earth tones, arrive at the hill crest, expressions of sorrow and regret; 3) the shepherd boy as a slightly older child, sitting quietly tending his sheep (smaller than in the previous scenes), wearing a more subdued color palette, the villagers appearing smaller and further away, suggesting passing time and trust rebuilding, all rendered in a soft, slightly muted watercolor style." src="/images/image_the-shepherd-boy-and-the-wolf0.png" width="1024" height="876">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration depicting the story of the shepherd boy who cried wolf.  Three panels: Panel 1: The boy, with short brown hair and wearing a light blue shirt, laughs mischievously as he points towards a hill, shouting &ldquo;Wolf!&rdquo;; villagers with ruddy complexions and simple brown clothes rush towards the hill. Panel 2: The boy watches with a guilty expression as villagers angrily descend the hill, their expressions painted in deep crimson. Panel 3: The boy sits in heartbroken sorrow among his dead sheep, the dying light casting long shadows, while villagers arrive, their faces a mixture of sadness and regret, all using a consistent color palette and character design for clarity and cohesion, in a painterly watercolor style." src="/images/image_the-shepherd-boy-and-the-wolf1.png" width="1024" height="492">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting in a naive style. Three distinct scenes:  Scene 1: A small shepherd boy, with dark hair and a simple red tunic (color maintained throughout), stands on a gently sloping hill, his sheep near him; the villagers run towards him, their clothes are mainly in browns and yellows.  Scene 2: The shepherd boy is smaller in this scene,  a few villagers appear frustrated, their faces red, showing that he lied. Scene 3: The boy kneels amidst his dead sheep, weeping, while villagers approach him solemnly, his red tunic remains the same, a somber atmosphere, all painted with soft watercolor washes, maintaining consistent character design throughout." src="/images/image_the-shepherd-boy-and-the-wolf2.png" width="1024" height="731">

<p>A long, long time ago, in a small village, lived a shepherd boy. Every day, he took his sheep to graze on a small hill near the village.</p>
<p>He was bored of doing the same thing every day.  So, to have some fun, he played a trick. He shouted loudly up the hill, &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf! A wolf is chasing the sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the villagers heard his shout, they rushed to the hill to chase away the wolf. But when they got there, they didn&rsquo;t see any wolf. The boy was happy to see their angry faces. He enjoyed this trick.</p>
<p>All the villagers warned the boy, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout &lsquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rsquo; when there is no wolf!&rdquo;  They went back down the hill, very angry.</p>
<p>The next day, for fun, the shepherd boy shouted again, &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf! A wolf is chasing the sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing his voice, the villagers ran towards the hill again. The boy saw the villagers running to scare away the wolf and felt happy.</p>
<p>When they saw there was no wolf, they scolded the boy again, telling him he should only call for help if there was a real wolf. The boy smiled to himself as the villagers went down the hill.</p>
<p>After a few days, the boy saw a real wolf approaching his flock!  He was scared and jumped up and down, shouting as loud as he could, &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rdquo; But this time, the villagers thought he was playing a trick again, and they didn&rsquo;t come to help.</p>
<p>At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn&rsquo;t returned with his sheep. When they reached the hill, they found the boy crying next to his dead sheep.</p>
<p>Seeing the villagers, the boy said, &ldquo;There really was a wolf! I shouted, &lsquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rsquo; but you didn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>An old man went to comfort the boy, putting his hand on his back.  He said, &ldquo;No one believes a liar, even when he&rsquo;s telling the truth! Your little trick cost many sheep their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd boy understood his mistake. He never played tricks on the villagers again.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Never tell lies or play mean tricks. It can hurt you and others.  People won&rsquo;t trust you if you lie.</p>
