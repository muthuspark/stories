<p>A long time ago, in a big forest, lived a family of ants and a grasshopper.  One day, just before winter, the ants were busy gathering food, sticks, and leaves for the cold months ahead.</p>
<p>The grasshopper watched them from afar. He saw how busy the ants were, but he was just relaxing in the sun.  He hopped over to them and asked, &ldquo;What are you all doing on such a nice day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the ants replied, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting ready for winter. You should store some food too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper laughed and hopped away. He spent his days chasing butterflies and basking in the sun.</p>
<p>The days went by.  The ants kept working, while the grasshopper just played.</p>
<p>One morning, the grasshopper woke up to a cold, snowy day.  The ground was covered in ice! He hopped around looking for food, but he couldn&rsquo;t find anything. He had to go hungry that day.  He finally understood that the ants were right!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Time waits for no one. We should always make the most of our opportunities and prepare for the future.</p>
