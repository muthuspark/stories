        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of King Krishnadevaraya, Tenali Rama, and a foreign merchant in the vibrant Vijayanagara court.  King Krishnadevaraya, in regal purple and gold, sits on his throne. Tenali Rama, in a warm ochre robe, is examining one of three identical-looking porcelain dolls, meticulously detailed with a tiny hole in each ear. The merchant, dressed in rich blues and greens, stands confidently observing them.  The background should suggest a grand palace setting with hints of a bustling court scene. Focus on the delicate details of the dolls and the expressions on the faces of the three main characters. Use a muted color palette for the background to emphasize the dolls and characters." src="/images/image_the-three-dolls0.png" width="1024" height="728">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting Tenali Rama holding the three identical dolls. The dolls should be the central focus, painted with precise detail showing the subtle differences—one with a wire emerging from the mouth, one from the opposite ear, and one disappearing inside. Tenali Rama should be portrayed in a thoughtful pose, his expression conveying intelligence and understanding. Use a warm, earthy color palette with cool blues and greens accentuating the dolls&rsquo; significance. The background can be a simple, soft wash of color, allowing the dolls and Tenali Rama to stand out." src="/images/image_the-three-dolls1.png" width="1024" height="862">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor scene showing the climax of the story: Tenali Rama demonstrating the wire test on the three dolls to King Krishnadevaraya and the impressed court.  King Krishnadevaraya should be depicted with a look of admiration and understanding, while the courtiers display expressions of awe.  Tenali Rama, a consistent size and shape in all three prompts, should have a confident yet humble posture. The dolls should be clearly visible, highlighting the contrasting pathways of the wires. Use a bright, celebratory color palette with gold accents for the royal setting and a contrasting cool tone for Tenali Rama&rsquo;s clothing to emphasize his character." src="/images/image_the-three-dolls2.png" width="1024" height="636">

<p>A long time ago, during the reign of King Krishnadevaraya, a merchant from a faraway land visited the Vijayanagara court. He told the king, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard tales of your court&rsquo;s wisdom. I have a test for you!&rdquo;  The king let him continue.</p>
<p>The merchant said, &ldquo;I have three dolls. They look exactly alike, but they are different.  Tell me how they are different. I&rsquo;ll return in 30 days for your answer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king called his ministers, but nobody knew the answer.  Even Tenali Rama, the king&rsquo;s clever advisor, was puzzled! Tenali Rama asked the king to take the dolls home. He examined them carefully, trying everything he could think of, but time was running out.</p>
<p>When the merchant returned, Tenali Rama stepped forward and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the difference! One doll is good, one is average, and one is bad!&rdquo;  Everyone was amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? Show us!&rdquo; the king asked.</p>
<p>Tenali Rama showed a tiny hole in each doll&rsquo;s ear. He then carefully inserted a thin wire into each ear.</p>
<p>In the first doll, the wire went in one ear and came out the mouth. In the second doll, it went in one ear and out the other. In the third doll, the wire went in the ear, but disappeared into the doll&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first doll is bad,&rdquo; Tenali Rama explained, &ldquo;because it represents people who can&rsquo;t keep secrets. The second doll is average; it represents people who are straightforward and don&rsquo;t understand hidden meanings. The third doll is good; it represents those who can keep secrets!&rdquo; Everyone was impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong>  Curiosity and a willingness to learn are the only ways to expand our experiences and understanding.</p>
