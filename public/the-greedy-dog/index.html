        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a brown and white dog, consistently sized and shaped throughout the painting.  The dog is depicted in three scenes: 1) excitedly discovering a large, juicy bone in a grassy field, 2) standing at a riverbank, looking intently at its reflection (another identical brown and white dog with a bone in its mouth), and 3) sadly looking at the muddy river after the bone has fallen in. The river water should be a translucent blue-grey, becoming cloudy around the area where the bone fell.  The background should be softly rendered with watercolor washes, using muted greens for the grass and cool blues and grays for the river. Focus on creating a slightly naive, childlike style of watercolor painting." src="/images/image_the-greedy-dog0.png" width="1024" height="724">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a story about a greedy dog.  The dog, a consistent medium-sized tan-colored dog with floppy ears, is shown in three panels.  Panel 1: The dog joyfully finds a large, realistically rendered bone. Panel 2:  The dog is by a calm river, seeing its reflection, another identical dog with a bone. Panel 3: The dog is dejected, the river is now murky brown, and the bone is gone. Use loose watercolor washes for the background—a sunny yellow for the field, a soft blue for the sky reflecting on the water, and muddy browns and greys for the disturbed water in the final panel.  Maintain consistent style and color for the dog throughout." src="/images/image_the-greedy-dog1.png" width="1024" height="564">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 622;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting in a whimsical style depicting a hungry, light brown dog with oversized, expressive eyes. The dog is depicted three times: 1) sniffing out a glistening, large bone in a field of bright, loose watercolor washes of green and yellow, 2) facing a river with a clear reflection of itself holding the same bone, 3) sadly sitting by a now cloudy, dark-blueish river, the bone lost.  The dog should be consistently drawn, with the same size and color throughout, emphasizing its emotions through its eyes and body language. Use soft, translucent watercolor techniques to create a dreamy, slightly melancholic mood." src="/images/image_the-greedy-dog2.png" width="1024" height="622">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a very hungry dog. He was looking for food everywhere.</p>
<p>While searching, he found a big, juicy bone! He quickly grabbed it in his mouth and started walking home.</p>
<p>On his way home, he had to cross a river.  When he got to the river, he saw his reflection in the water.</p>
<p>The dog thought, &ldquo;Look! Another dog with a bone! I should grab that one too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to try and bite the other dog (which was just his reflection), and <em>splash</em>! His bone fell into the river and sank. The water got cloudy, and his reflection disappeared.</p>
<p>The dog understood what happened. He was sad because he lost his bone. He went home and slept hungry that night.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Greediness makes us lose what we already have.  It&rsquo;s important to be happy with what we have!</p>
