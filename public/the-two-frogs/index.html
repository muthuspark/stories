<p>Once upon a time, a group of frogs was looking for water in the forest.  Suddenly, two frogs accidentally fell into a deep pit!</p>
<p>The other frogs were worried about their friends.  The pit was very deep, and they told the two frogs that there was no way out and that it was useless to try.</p>
<p>They kept discouraging the two frogs as they tried to jump out.  The two frogs tried and tried, but they couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>Soon, one of the frogs started to believe the other frogs. He thought he would never escape and sadly, he gave up and died.</p>
<p>But the other frog kept trying! He jumped and jumped, and finally, he leaped so high that he hopped right out of the pit! The other frogs were amazed. How did he do it?</p>
<p>The difference was, the second frog was deaf! He couldn&rsquo;t hear the other frogs discouraging him. He thought they were cheering him on and encouraging his jumps!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Other people&rsquo;s opinions only affect you if you let them. Believe in yourself and don&rsquo;t let others discourage you!</p>
