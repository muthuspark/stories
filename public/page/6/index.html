        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a sprawling banyan tree teeming with dark grey crows, one significantly larger representing King Meghavarana.  Near the tree, a dark cave mouth is visible, with several brown owls perched near the entrance, one larger owl representing King Arimaradana.  A small, wise-looking brown owl (Sthirajeevi) is shown separately, appearing both near the crows and the owls, subtly suggesting his movement between the two groups.  The background is a soft wash of purples and oranges suggesting sunset, with the Rshyamukam Mountain faintly visible in the distance as a silhouette. A small fire is visible near the owl&rsquo;s cave." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-war-of-crows-and-owls0.png" width="829" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting Yadnyavalkya, a Guru with calm features and flowing white robes, gently placing a tiny mouse onto a large green leaf near a river.  The mouse is light brown, and the Guru&rsquo;s skin is a warm brown.  The sun shines gently on the scene, and a partially visible hawk is flying in the background.  The young girl, now a radiant figure with a flowing yellow dress, is depicted briefly, a translucent figure slightly overlapping with the Guru. A hint of the sun, clouds, wind, and mountains is shown in the far background to symbolize her choices for husbands." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-wedding-of-mouse1.png" width="1024" height="828">
