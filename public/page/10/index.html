Near the tree, a dark cave mouth is visible, with several brown owls perched near the entrance, one larger owl representing King Arimaradana.  A small, wise-looking brown owl (Sthirajeevi) is shown separately, appearing both near the crows and the owls, subtly suggesting his movement between the two groups.  The background is a soft wash of purples and oranges suggesting sunset, with the Rshyamukam Mountain faintly visible in the distance as a silhouette.

The mouse is light brown, and the Guru&rsquo;s skin is a warm brown.  The sun shines gently on the scene, and a partially visible hawk is flying in the background.  The young girl, now a radiant figure with a flowing yellow dress, is depicted briefly, a translucent figure slightly overlapping with the Guru.

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>One day, a fisherwoman was walking past the palace, calling out about her fish. The queen looked out of a window and waved her over to see what she had. Just then, a really big fish jumped in the basket!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A vibrant watercolor illustration of a fisherwoman in simple, patched linen clothes, carrying a woven basket overflowing with glistening, colorful fish – silver scales, ruby reds, and emerald greens shimmering under the bright morning sun. A majestic palace with sun-drenched, arched windows is in the background, its white stone warmed by the golden light. A regal queen with a delicate, jeweled crown leans out of a window, her silk robes billowing gently in the breeze, waving a slender hand towards the fisherwoman with a kind smile. A large, anthropomorphic fish – a golden carp with intelligent eyes – leaps dramatically from the basket, its mouth open in a wide, joyful grin, scattering droplets of water that catch the light like diamonds. Soft, diffused light creates subtle shadows on the palace walls and the fisherwoman&rsquo;s weathered face. The overall tone is cheerful and whimsical." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-why-the-fish-laughed0.png" width="1024" height="722">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Vijay discovering wild strawberries in a sun-dappled clearing. He is kneeling in the damp grass, his fingers gently separating the broad, green leaves to reveal a small, bright red strawberry hidden beneath. The sun filters through the canopy of trees overhead, casting dappled shadows on the ground, creating a mosaic of light and shade. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves. He&rsquo;s surrounded by ferns and moss-covered rocks. The color palette is dominated by lush greens, vibrant reds, and warm yellows, conveying a sense of natural beauty and hope. Vijay&rsquo;s face is illuminated with a mixture of wonder and anticipation. His small hand gently plucks the berry. The watercolor technique captures the delicate textures of the leaves, the moist earth, and the plumpness of the strawberry. Soft blending creates a sense of tranquility and intimacy." src="/posts/images/image_ruskin-wild-fruit2.png" width="1024" height="1024">
