        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Mr. Stingy (Svabhavakripana), a thin man with a slightly hunched back, lying in a worn, straw-filled bed. He wears simple, patched earth-toned clothing, a coarse linen shirt barely covering his ribs. Above him, hanging precariously from a rusty hook on the whitewashed wall, is a large, rustic clay pot overflowing with glistening white rice. A single shaft of moonlight, piercing through a crack in the wooden shutters, illuminates the pot, casting long, dramatic shadows across the room. He gazes up at the pot with wide, greedy eyes that reflect the moonlight, a faint, almost manic smile playing on his thin lips. The room is dimly lit, the color palette muted grays and browns, emphasizing the golden glow of the rice as the focal point, contrasting with the poverty of the setting. The texture of the roughly plastered wall and the coarse blanket are visible details." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-broken-pot0.png" width="1024" height="721">

Light filters through the leaves, dappling the bird in shifting shadows and highlights. The tree has a single, prominent green bud, glistening with morning dew. The bird, with its head cocked inquisitively and feathers slightly ruffled by a gentle breeze, is looking intently at the bud with a hopeful, almost pleading expression. The background is a sun-drenched, cerulean sky with soft, blurred trees in the distance rendered in muted greens and blues. Fine watercolor details highlight the intricate bark of the cotton tree and the delicate veins of the leaves.

The tiger&rsquo;s mom looks weak and has matted fur; she&rsquo;s lying down on a bed of damp leaves, her breathing shallow. The cat is gently holding the tiger&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s paw with a concerned expression, her brow furrowed. Lush, emerald and jade foliage with broad leaves and trailing vines surrounds them. Dappled sunlight, warm and golden, filters through the trees, creating a play of light and shadow on the jungle floor.

Splatters of bright orange and yellow paint suggest the setting sun. The background is a slightly blurred, impressionistic rendering of a cozy living room with a worn wooden floor, a plush red rug, and a glimpse of a window showing a fiery sunset.

The villagers, their faces etched with gratitude and weathered by the sun, hold a scruffy brown dog with matted fur and hopeful eyes. The 100 rupee note is slightly crumpled, a symbol of its value.
