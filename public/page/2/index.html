<p>Once upon a time, there was a very rich old man. He thought he was about to say goodbye to the world, so he called his sons together and shared all his money and things with them. But guess what? He didn&rsquo;t go anywhere for many years! And those years weren&rsquo;t very happy ones. He was tired from being old, but even worse, his sons were not very nice to him. They were being mean and selfish!</p> </p>

The drum sits in a battlefield setting, rendered in muted greens, browns, and greys.  Dried leaves and twigs are scattered around the drum and food items, such as berries and a small pool of water, are visible near it. The sky is a soft, pale watercolor wash of blue and grey.

A lion, with a golden mane and muscular body, is walking away in the background. A leopard with dark spots and a tiger with orange and black stripes are also visible, both looking fearful and running away from the elephant. The elephant&rsquo;s skin is thick and grey, partially torn open revealing its inner flesh.  Use vibrant, contrasting colors for the jungle scene, creating a feeling of excitement and triumph.

Perched near him is a small, expressive monkey, its fur rendered in warm browns and tans, holding a tiny, decorative sword. Its facial expression is a mix of concern and mischief. A small, almost translucent fly is subtly present near the king’s face. The background is simple, using soft washes of muted greens and blues to emphasize the figures in the foreground.
