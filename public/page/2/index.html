        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a dramatic scene: Karalakesara, a large, tawny lion with a bandaged paw, lies near a riverbank, looking weary.  A small, sly-looking jackal, with fur the color of burnt umber, stands near him, eyes fixed on a grey donkey, whose silhouette is slightly visible in the cave entrance. The cave opening is shaded and dark. The overall color palette is warm earthy tones with cool blues in the river. The style is expressive and slightly whimsical." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-lion-and-foolish-donkey0.png" width="1024" height="574">

The lion is slightly injured, looking distressed.  The background should suggest a feeling of impending doom, with dark, stormy clouds gathering.

<p>A lion named Vajra lived in the jungle with his friends, a jackal and a wolf.  One day, a sick camel was left behind by a caravan.  The lion ate the camel, but the baby camel was too little to eat, so the lion kept it as a pet.</p> </p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a dramatic jungle scene. The focus should be on four distinct figures: three in similar attire (flowing robes in shades of olive green and deep turquoise) representing the scholarly friends, and one smaller figure in warm browns and oranges, the clever friend. The three scholars are engaged in reassembling a lion skeleton, which is partially covered in translucent watercolor washes suggesting skin and muscle.  The clever friend, noticeably smaller, observes from a tall tree in the background, his posture and expression conveying worry. The lion&rsquo;s head should be slightly larger than the other elements to emphasize the looming danger.  The overall style should be reminiscent of a classic watercolor illustration, with visible brushstrokes and a focus on texture." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-lion-that-sprang-to-life2.png" width="1024" height="818">

The background features lush, green jungle foliage, with hints of sunset colors in the sky.
