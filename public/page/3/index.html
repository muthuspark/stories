On the other side, a regal King, depicted in rich purples and golds, is looking at Yudhisthira with a mix of surprise and slight embarrassment.  In the background, faintly depict broken pottery pieces in warm browns and oranges, suggesting Yudhisthira&rsquo;s humble beginnings as a potter, and a faint suggestion of a battlefield in muted grays and browns. The overall style should be gentle and slightly melancholic, emphasizing Yudhisthira&rsquo;s inherent goodness and the irony of the situation." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-story-of-potter0.png" width="1024" height="573">

<p>Sindhuka the bird lived high in a big tree on a tall mountain.  Her poo was special – it turned into gold!</p>
<p>One day, a hunter came to the mountain. He couldn&rsquo;t find any animals to hunt, so he rested under Sindhuka&rsquo;s tree.  Plop! Sindhuka pooped, and it landed near the hunter, turning into gold! The hunter was amazed!</p>
<p>He thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen bird poo turn into gold! I have to catch that bird!&rdquo;  He set a trap, and Sindhuka, who wasn&rsquo;t looking, got caught.</p> </p>

<p>One hot summer day, a little ant was looking for water.  She walked and walked until she saw a river.  She was so happy! She climbed onto a small rock to take a drink, but she slipped and fell into the water!</p>
<p>Just then, a dove saw her. The dove was sitting in a nearby tree.  Seeing the ant in trouble, the dove quickly dropped a leaf into the water.</p> </p>
