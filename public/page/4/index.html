Balna, slightly separated and looking skeptical, observes a gaunt, elderly woman (Prudhan&rsquo;s widow) with deeply etched wrinkles taking firewood from a cast-iron stove. Soft light streams through a high arched window, casting long shadows. Dust motes dance in the light. Dirt subtly scatters from the widow&rsquo;s gnarled hands, falling towards a simmering pot of stew. The wooden floor is worn and uneven. The color palette is muted, with earthy tones and hints of faded gold. Balna&rsquo;s expression is a mix of suspicion and compassion, her body language guarded. The other princesses, dressed in colorful, slightly faded silk gowns, are focused on the widow with varying degrees of concern.

Sunlight, a warm golden hue, streams through a large, arched window with delicate Mughal-inspired latticework, casting intricate shadows across the polished marble floor. Her gaze is downcast towards her lap, where her hands are clasped tightly, her knuckles white. A single, shimmering tear rolls down her cheek, catching the light. The palace architecture features intricate Mughal-inspired designs: ornate columns, jewel-toned mosaics, and tapestries depicting scenes of past glory.

<p>One hot summer day, a little ant was looking for water.  She walked and walked until she saw a river.  She was so happy! She climbed onto a small rock to take a drink, but she slipped and fell into the water!</p>
<p>Just then, a dove saw her. The dove was sitting in a nearby tree.  Seeing the ant in trouble, the dove quickly dropped a leaf into the water.</p> </p>

The rich brown mud splashes slightly as he works.

She points upwards with a dirty, soil-stained finger towards a bird&rsquo;s nest high in the branches. Seven other young girls, ranging in age, giggle and laugh with amusement, their faces flushed with joy. Some wear simple cotton dresses, others patched and worn clothing.
