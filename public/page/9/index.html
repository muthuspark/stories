        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Usha, Suresh, and Binya on a windy hilltop village. They are securing vibrant, patched clothes – a faded blue shirt, a red and yellow sari – to a crumbling stone wall with jagged-edged rocks. Usha has dark, windblown hair framing a face with rosy cheeks, her brow furrowed in concentration. Suresh is younger and smaller, clutching a stone tightly, his eyes wide with exertion. Binya is slightly older than Usha, her hands deftly pinning a colorful cloth, a serene expression on her face despite the harsh wind. In the background, a distant, dilapidated town sits atop another hill, partially obscured by blowing wind and a hazy, grey sky tinged with a touch of lavender. The watercolor effect should emphasize the texture of the stone, the wind&rsquo;s movement through the clothing, and the soft, diffused light typical of a windy day. The overall tone is one of resilience and quiet determination, rendered with delicate watercolor washes." src="/posts/images/image_ruskin-the-wind-on-haunted-hill0.png" width="682" height="1024">

<p>The guard wondered who this sadhu was and why he claimed to be the king&rsquo;s brother.  He thought maybe it was a distant relative who had become a sadhu.  The guard told the king, who smiled and said, &ldquo;Let the sadhu in.&rdquo;</p> </p>

The darker figure is subtly positioned in the center, looking anxious amidst the other four Brahmins who are gathered around a small pile of sparkling jewel-toned watercolors. The scene is set against a rich background of deep greens and browns, suggestive of a jungle setting.  The overall mood is one of suspense and intrigue, with a focus on the facial expressions of the Brahmins. The jewel colors should be vibrant and reflective, suggesting the precious nature of the stolen gems.

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>Most villages in the Himalaya mountains are in valleys. Valleys have little streams, some places to grow food, and they&rsquo;re safe from the super cold winds that blow through the mountains in winter. The houses are usually built with big rocks and have slanted roofs made of stone, so the heavy rain can slide right off. When it&rsquo;s sunny in the fall, you&rsquo;ll often see pumpkins on the roofs, getting all nice and ripe in the sun.</p> </p>

Long shadows stretch from the tiger, highlighting the texture of its fur. The tiger&rsquo;s tail, tipped with black, is just visible above the golden grass.

<p>In the jungle of Ajanar, lived two strong lions, Shursingh and Singraj. Shursingh was getting old and couldn&rsquo;t hunt anymore.</p>
<p>Singraj would hunt for him and bring him food.  When Singraj went hunting, Shursingh was all alone.  The other animals were too scared to go near him.</p>
<p>One day, a pack of jackals saw Shursingh alone.  They thought they found a big meal! They surrounded him and bit him, hurting him badly. Shursingh fainted.</p> </p>
