        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a thirsty crow, rendered in muted browns and grays, with bright, expressive eyes. The crow is perched on the rim of a small, terracotta-colored pot, which contains a tiny amount of water at the bottom.  Several smooth, grey pebbles are scattered around the pot and a few are already inside, raising the water level slightly. The background is a sunny, hazy yellow and orange landscape, suggesting a hot summer day.  The crow&rsquo;s posture should convey determination and cleverness.  The style should be reminiscent of classic children&rsquo;s book illustrations." src="/images/image_the-thirsty-crow0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor scene depicting a crow, primarily black with subtle iridescent blue-green highlights,  struggling to reach water in a low, earthenware pot.  The pot is a warm ochre color, sitting on parched, cracked earth painted in dusty browns and oranges. The crow is depicted in a slightly cartoonish style, maintaining realistic proportions but with simplified features and expressive eyes. Small, grey pebbles are scattered around the pot, with a few already carefully placed inside to raise the water level. The background features a sun-drenched, bright yellow sky." src="/images/image_the-thirsty-crow1.png" width="1024" height="764">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a happy crow, dark grey with hints of charcoal black, drinking from a small, glazed clay pot (pale terracotta). The pot is partially filled with water, the level noticeably higher than before.  Several grey pebbles are visible inside the pot, slightly submerged.  The crow is depicted with a joyful expression and slightly ruffled feathers, suggesting recent exertion. The background is a softly painted wash of warm oranges and yellows, suggesting the setting sun, adding a peaceful, contented feeling. Focus on soft washes of color and detailed rendering of the crow&rsquo;s feathers." src="/images/image_the-thirsty-crow2.png" width="1024" height="694">

<p>Once upon a time, on a hot summer day, a crow was very, very thirsty. He flew here and there, looking for water, but couldn&rsquo;t find any.  The hot sun made him even thirstier! He almost gave up hope. But he didn&rsquo;t! He kept looking, and then&hellip; he saw it! A pot with a little bit of water in it. He was so happy!</p>
<p>He tried to drink, but the water was too low down. He couldn&rsquo;t reach it!  Just as he was about to give up again, he saw some pebbles nearby.  He had a clever idea! He picked up the pebbles, one by one, in his beak and dropped them into the pot. Slowly, slowly, the water level rose!  Finally, there was enough water for him to drink. He drank his fill and happily flew away.</p>
<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> When we really want something and we work hard for it, we can achieve it!</p>
