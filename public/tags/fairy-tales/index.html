<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor, blind dad and mom who depended on their son to help them get by. Every day, the son would go out and ask people for food. He did this for a long time, but he got really tired of living such a tough life. So, he decided to try his luck in a different place.</p> </p>

<p>Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, when King Brahma-datta was in charge of Benares, the future Buddha was born as his son! When it was time to give the little prince a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew up big and strong, and when he turned sixteen, he went to a special school called Takkasila. There, he learned all sorts of amazing things. After his dad, the king, passed away, he became the new king and promised to be fair and kind to everyone.</p> </p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a kind-faced young man with sun-kissed skin and gentle eyes, giving 100 rupees to a group of villagers. The scene is bathed in the warm, golden light of late afternoon, casting long shadows across the dusty Indian village streets. The villagers, their faces etched with gratitude and weathered by the sun, hold a scruffy brown dog with matted fur and hopeful eyes. The 100 rupee note is slightly crumpled, a symbol of its value. Buildings in the background are made of mud brick, their walls adorned with faded paint and crumbling plaster, showcasing traditional Indian village architecture. Watercolors are blended softly, evoking a feeling of warmth and kindness. A small tea stall with chipped paint can be seen in the background." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-charmed-ring0.png" width="1024" height="722">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A serene and slightly melancholic watercolor illustration of a lush forest scene at twilight. Soft, golden light filters through the canopy, creating long, dappled shadows. A gentle, glowing tree spirit with a kindly, yet worried face, stands near a pond filled with vibrant, fading lotus flowers. The pond&rsquo;s water level is noticeably low, exposing muddy banks and cracked earth. Several fish with large, expressive eyes swim nervously near the surface, their scales shimmering with iridescent hues. The air is thick with humidity, and the scent of damp earth hangs heavy. Artistic style: detailed watercolor with soft blending and a touch of whimsy." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the Teacher (Buddha), sitting in Jetavana, surrounded by monks. The monks are young and old, their faces reflecting rapt attention. The Teacher has a serene expression, his eyes closed in contemplation, a gentle smile gracing his lips. He is seated on a simple mat beneath a bodhi tree, its leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The air is filled with the scent of incense. In the background, subtly depicted as transparent, ethereal images, are faint, ghost-like images of the Prince and the Demon, locked in their struggle and eventual understanding. These ghostly figures are integrated into the trees and foliage. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of tranquility. Color palette: Earthy tones, with soft greens and browns, and a hint of gold. Emotional tone: Peaceful, wise, contemplative. Artistic style: Watercolor with a focus on spiritual serenity and subtle details." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair6.png" width="1024" height="611">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration, late afternoon golden hour. A weary farmer with ragged, patched clothes stained with earth stands in front of the ornate, sun-drenched house of a plump and richly dressed money lender. The money lender&rsquo;s house boasts intricately carved wooden doors and vibrant, blooming jasmine climbing its walls. The farmer, face etched with worry and sweat glistening on his brow, gestures with open, trembling hands in desperation. Long shadows stretch from the farmer and the house. The color palette is warm, with oranges and yellows dominating, but a somber gray clinging to the farmer. Texture: rough, woven mat outside the money lender&rsquo;s door, contrasting with the smoothness of the farmer&rsquo;s calloused hands." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-farmer-and-the-money-lender0.png" width="1024" height="680">

He wears simple, patched brown homespun clothing. He&rsquo;s napping fitfully under the sprawling, gnarled branches of a colossal banyan tree in a golden wheat field, the wheat swaying gently in the breeze. The late afternoon sun casts long, dappled shadows across the field. A large, imposing cobra with scales that shimmer with subtle iridescence and a proudly raised hood is emerging from a small, crumbling earthen mound near the tree roots. The mound is covered in dry, cracked earth and scattered pebbles. The air is thick with the scent of dry grass and warm earth.

Golden sunlight casts long shadows, highlighting the prince&rsquo;s focused expression as he aims an arrow. The prince wears a tunic of deep green with gold trim, while his friend, in a simple brown tunic, stands beside him, smiling and holding a polished wooden bow. An arrow streaks through the air towards a distant, multi-paned window of a nearby castle, leaving a faint blur trail. The lush grass is dotted with wildflowers in shades of yellow and purple.

Sunlight dappled with long shadows dances through the leaves of towering oak trees in the background, creating a sense of whimsical joy.
