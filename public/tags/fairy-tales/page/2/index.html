        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration, midday sun casting sharp shadows, of seven women standing around a weathered stone well, their faces etched with accusatory glares. They point dramatically at a young woman with a cracked clay jar, water spilling from its side. A small, mischievous-looking Bonga, with large, iridescent eyes, lurks nearby, partially obscured by swaying reeds. The sky is a pale cerulean blue with soft, cumulus clouds, casting a dappled light on the scene. The watercolor style emphasizes soft blending, with visible brushstrokes suggesting the rough texture of the well stones and the woven fabric of the women&rsquo;s clothes. The overall tone is tense and suspicious." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-magic-fiddle0.png" width="1024" height="722">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a weary, defeated King lying face down at a dusty crossroads at twilight. Four paths, overgrown with weeds, stretch in different directions. Long, dramatic shadows from the setting sun emphasize his prone form. People with uncaring expressions walk over him, their feet kicking up dust motes illuminated by the golden light. A wise man with a long, flowing grey beard and deep wrinkles etched with sorrow stands beside him, looking down with profound concern, his hand resting gently on his gnarled wooden staff. The King&rsquo;s tarnished gold crown has fallen askew, nestled in the dirt. The color palette is muted browns, oranges, and greys, creating a somber, melancholic tone. Texture of rough cobblestones and worn leather sandals are evident. Soft watercolor blending allows light to filter through wisps of clouds." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-prince-and-the-fakir0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

The King, seated on a gold-leaf throne, is surrounded by seven beautiful Queens, all looking melancholic. Soft, dappled sunlight streams through stained-glass windows, casting long shadows on the polished marble floor. The man&rsquo;s beard has individual strands visible, and his clothes are slightly worn, adding to his humbleness. The King&rsquo;s crown glints, but his face is etched with worry lines. The Queens are dressed in rich velvet gowns in muted jewel tones, their faces pale and tear-streaked. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, but subtly tinged with sadness. Texture: The throne&rsquo;s velvet cushion is slightly worn, and the marble floor reflects the light unevenly.

The room has a dirt floor, a rough wooden table, and cracked plaster walls.

The Buddha stands beside him in the Benares palace, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a late afternoon. The king appears to be talking excessively, gesturing wildly with his hands, his face flushed with excitement. The wise man maintains a calm, patient demeanor, his eyes downcast and his hands clasped in front of him. The palace interior features intricately carved wooden pillars casting long shadows across the polished stone floor. Tapestries of deep indigo and ochre adorn the walls. The air is thick with the scent of incense.

The time is early morning; sunlight filters through the jungle canopy, casting dappled shadows on the cage floor. The tiger, an orange blaze against the dark iron, is snarling, its black stripes rippling with tension as it claws at the rust-covered bars. Its eyes burn with rage. Brahman, a kind-looking man with simple, earth-toned clothing – a faded dhoti and shawl – stands outside the cage, looking concerned, his brow furrowed with worry. His hands are clasped nervously. Lush green jungle foliage, with vibrant emerald greens and deep shadows, surrounds them. Vines creep up the cage bars. The air is thick with humidity, hinted at by a slight shimmer in the distance. Artistic style: Soft, natural watercolor with flowing washes and delicate details, emphasizing the contrast between the raw power of the tiger and Brahman&rsquo;s gentle nature." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal0.png" width="1024" height="680">

A majestic palace with sun-drenched, arched windows is in the background, its white stone warmed by the golden light. A regal queen with a delicate, jeweled crown leans out of a window, her silk robes billowing gently in the breeze, waving a slender hand towards the fisherwoman with a kind smile. A large, anthropomorphic fish – a golden carp with intelligent eyes – leaps dramatically from the basket, its mouth open in a wide, joyful grin, scattering droplets of water that catch the light like diamonds. Soft, diffused light creates subtle shadows on the palace walls and the fisherwoman&rsquo;s weathered face.
