        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of two small, round birds, Pip and Pop, Pip is blue and Pop is yellow. Pip is perched on a branch high in a lush green jungle tree, while Pop is in a small hole at the base of the tree. A brown bunny, Floppy, is peeking out of Pop&rsquo;s hole. In the background, a slightly blurry image of a wise-looking grey cat sitting near a flowing river, holding a long blade of grass. The overall style should be whimsical and slightly melancholic, reflecting the story&rsquo;s ending.  Focus on vibrant jungle colors and soft watercolor textures." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-cunning-mediator0.png" width="1024" height="563">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting focusing on Chitranga, a small brown dog with expressive eyes, surrounded by a circle of other similarly colored dogs of similar size and shape.  The scene is dominated by a palette of warm browns, ochres, and muted greens, conveying a sense of home and belonging.   A faint suggestion of a distant house, with a hint of brighter colors depicting food, is barely visible in the background, emphasizing the emotional connection between Chitranga and his fellow dogs over the lure of plentiful food." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-dog-who-went-abroad2.png" width="1024" height="574">

The farmers are visible in the background, their figures less prominent, suggesting the aftermath of the chase. The overall color palette is subdued, with browns, greys, and muted greens dominating.

A mean-looking hunter (dark, earthy tones) is shown under the tree, shivering, next to a cage containing a dove (soft pink). Another dove (same pink, similar shape) is approaching the hunter, offering burning leaves.  The background shows a stormy sky with rain.

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a jungle scene. A sad mama sparrow, depicted in muted browns and grays, sits near a broken nest with cracked eggs.  A large, grumpy elephant, rendered in deep gray and brown, is partially submerged in a muddy hole. A bright red woodpecker, a buzzing blue fly, and a green frog with large, wise eyes are gathered near the sparrow, looking at her with concern. The overall mood is one of sadness turning to hope. The background is a lush watercolor wash of greens and browns, suggesting a jungle environment.  The scale of the characters is consistent, with the elephant significantly larger than the other animals, which are similar in size to each other." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-elephant-and-sparrow0.png" width="1024" height="721">

Smaller brown bunnies, consistent in size and shape, watch from a nearby burrow, appearing relieved and safe.  The lake&rsquo;s surface is tranquil, reflecting a bright, full moon. The background shows the partially dried-up original pond and the lush green jungle.   Use contrasting color temperatures; cool blues and silvers for the water and moon, and warm earthy tones for the jungle and elephants.
