        </p>

        
        <p class="line-summary"> <p>Once upon a time, there was a barber named Hím who was very, very poor. He lived with his wife and a whole bunch of kids – twelve of them! Five were boys and seven were girls. Sometimes he would earn a little bit of money. One day, he felt super grumpy and left his home, leaving his wife and kids to take care of themselves.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration of Hím, a thin barber with a worried expression, holding a worn leather razor strap and a tarnished straight razor. Dawn light filters through the cracks in the wooden walls of his dilapidated house, casting long shadows. Twelve children of varying ages, their clothes patched and faded, stand before him, their faces gaunt and their eyes reflecting hunger and sadness. His wife stands framed in the doorway, her hands on her hips, her worn apron suggesting a life of endless toil, her concerned expression etched deep into her face. Patches of faded blue paint peel from the house, revealing the rough-hewn wood beneath. Chickens peck at the dusty ground. The overall color palette leans towards muted browns, grays, and blues, evoking a sense of poverty and desperation, but with hints of early morning gold adding a touch of hope. Soft blending is used to suggest worn textures." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-hm-and-the-tigers0.png" width="1024" height="628">

He rides a powerful, muscular white horse, its mane flowing in the wind. In the background, on the side of a dusty road with cracked earth and scattered pebbles, a sinister-looking, shadowy monster with glowing red eyes is mid-transformation into a beautiful queen with flowing dark hair and a deceptively alluring smile.

The cat is gently holding the tiger&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s paw with a concerned expression, her brow furrowed. Lush, emerald and jade foliage with broad leaves and trailing vines surrounds them. Dappled sunlight, warm and golden, filters through the trees, creating a play of light and shadow on the jungle floor.

Splatters of bright orange and yellow paint suggest the setting sun. The background is a slightly blurred, impressionistic rendering of a cozy living room with a worn wooden floor, a plush red rug, and a glimpse of a window showing a fiery sunset.

Maybe then He will give us children!&rdquo; The jackal said, &ldquo;Okay, good idea!&rdquo; That day, the kite didn&rsquo;t eat anything, not even that night. But the jackal waited until night, then secretly brought a dead animal and ate it under the tree. Crunch, crunch, crunch! The kite heard her munching on the bones instead of not eating. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got there?&rdquo; the kite asked. &ldquo;Why are you making so much noise?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said the jackal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just my own bones rattling around inside me when I move!&rdquo; The kite went back to sleep and didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the jackal. The next morning, the kite ate a little food to honor God. That night, the jackal brought another dead animal. The kite called out, &ldquo;What are you crunching? Why are you making that noise?

<p>Once upon a time, there was a King called the Pomegranate King, and a Queen called the Pomegranate Flower. The Queen passed away, leaving behind two little children: a girl about four or five years old, and a boy who was three. The King was very sad when she died because he loved her very much. He loved his two children a lot too! He got them two helpers: a cook to make their food, and a nanny to look after them. He also made sure they learned to read and write. Soon after his wife&rsquo;s passing, the daughter of another King lost her husband. She said she would marry another King if he wanted to marry her, and she really wanted to marry the Pomegranate King! So, her father went to visit the Pomegranate King and told him that his daughter wanted to marry him. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get married again. If I do, the woman I marry might not be nice to my two children. She won&rsquo;t take good care of them. She won&rsquo;t hug them and make them feel better when they&rsquo;re sad.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, but my daughter will be very good to them, I promise you,&rdquo; said the other King. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &ldquo;I will marry her.&rdquo; And so, they got married.</p> </p>
