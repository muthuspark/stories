He did this for a long time, but he got really tired of living such a tough life. So, he decided to try his luck in a different place.</p> </p>

When it was time to give the little prince a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew up big and strong, and when he turned sixteen, he went to a special school called Takkasila. There, he learned all sorts of amazing things. After his dad, the king, passed away, he became the new king and promised to be fair and kind to everyone.</p> </p>

<p>One day, the wrestler without a daughter heard about the wrestler with the daughter. He decided he wanted to wrestle him to see who was the strongest! So, he went to Ajit&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s town. When he got to their house, he knocked and said, &ldquo;Hello? Is anyone home?&rdquo; Ajit answered, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; and she came outside. The wrestler asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wrestler who lives here?&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;My dad took three hundred carts to the forest to get wood. He&rsquo;s pulling them himself because he couldn&rsquo;t find enough horses or cows to help!&rdquo; The wrestler was super surprised.

It was nighttime. This jungle was called the &ldquo;Tigers&rsquo; Jungle&rdquo; because only tigers lived there. No birds, no bugs, no other animals – just four hundred tigers! As soon as Barber Hím got to the jungle, he saw a big tiger walking around. &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This tiger is going to eat me for sure!&rdquo; He grabbed his razor and the leather strap he used to sharpen it and started making his razor really sharp.

Dawn light filters through the cracks in the wooden walls of his dilapidated house, casting long shadows.

His wife stands framed in the doorway, her hands on her hips, her worn apron suggesting a life of endless toil, her concerned expression etched deep into her face. Patches of faded blue paint peel from the house, revealing the rough-hewn wood beneath. Chickens peck at the dusty ground.

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>A long time ago, in a faraway place, there was a big fair. Lots of people came, even kings and queens from all over! One king brought his daughter with him. Near their tent, another king&rsquo;s son had his tent. He was very handsome, and the king&rsquo;s daughter was very pretty too!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a vibrant fair under a bright, sunny sky. Colorful tents of all shapes and sizes create a lively atmosphere. A handsome prince in regal attire of deep blues and golds, his face etched with longing, looks from his ornately decorated tent at a beautiful princess. She&rsquo;s dressed in fine clothes of soft pinks and creams, laughter lines crinkling around her eyes as she speaks to someone just out of frame. Kings and Queens in vibrant clothing - ruby reds, emerald greens, sapphire blues - are walking around the fair, their shadows long and dancing on the dusty ground. The watercolor style emphasizes soft blending and natural flow, creating a whimsical and slightly dreamlike feel. Wooden stalls overflow with tempting treats. Sunbeams filter through the tent canvas, dappling the scene with light and shadow." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-pnwpatt-rn0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, in a small village, lived ten cloth sellers who were best friends and always traveled together. One day, they went on a long trip to sell their beautiful fabrics and earned lots of money! As they headed back home, they had to pass through a thick, spooky forest. They didn&rsquo;t know it, but three sneaky robbers lived in that forest!</p> </p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration of seven princesses in a grand, dimly lit kitchen at dusk. Balna, slightly separated and looking skeptical, observes a gaunt, elderly woman (Prudhan&rsquo;s widow) with deeply etched wrinkles taking firewood from a cast-iron stove. Soft light streams through a high arched window, casting long shadows. Dust motes dance in the light. Dirt subtly scatters from the widow&rsquo;s gnarled hands, falling towards a simmering pot of stew. The wooden floor is worn and uneven. The color palette is muted, with earthy tones and hints of faded gold. Balna&rsquo;s expression is a mix of suspicion and compassion, her body language guarded. The other princesses, dressed in colorful, slightly faded silk gowns, are focused on the widow with varying degrees of concern. Watercolor style: soft blending, natural flow, subtle washes." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-punchkin0.png" width="721" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration of Queen Lona, dressed in royal blue velvet robes trimmed with intricate gold embroidery, sitting sadly on a jade-inlaid divan in her opulent palace. Sunlight, a warm golden hue, streams through a large, arched window with delicate Mughal-inspired latticework, casting intricate shadows across the polished marble floor. Her gaze is downcast towards her lap, where her hands are clasped tightly, her knuckles white. A single, shimmering tear rolls down her cheek, catching the light. The palace architecture features intricate Mughal-inspired designs: ornate columns, jewel-toned mosaics, and tapestries depicting scenes of past glory. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and golds, creating a somber yet majestic atmosphere. Soft blending emphasizes the melancholic mood. Texture is subtly applied to the velvet robes and marble flooring." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-raja-rasalu0.png" width="716" height="1024">

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>Once upon a time, there was a king named King Hamansa. He had a son named Prince Gursan, who married Princess Khelapari, the daughter of King Gulabsa. After the wedding, Prince Gursan took her home to his father&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>One day, Prince Gursan came home from hunting. He was super tired and really thirsty! It was around lunchtime. He asked Princess Khelapari to get him some water, and while she went to get it, he fell fast asleep. When she came back, he was still sleeping! He slept all afternoon and all night because he was so tired, and didn&rsquo;t wake up until the next morning. His wife stood by him the whole time, holding the water in a shiny cup. When he woke up and saw that she had been standing there all that time, he felt really bad. He asked for forgiveness and wished that his wife could have anything she wanted, no matter what it was! So, Princess Khelapari wished that she would know everything that happened in the world, even in faraway places, all by herself without anyone telling her.</p> </p>

Dew clings to the emerald blades of rice. His face is serene and focused, with a gentle smile playing on his lips. He wears simple, earth-toned robes. The rich brown mud splashes slightly as he works. The king&rsquo;s city of Benares can be seen distantly in the background, rendered in soft, muted tones of ochre and faded blues, partially obscured by a gentle morning mist.
