      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a barber named Hím who was very, very poor. He lived with his wife and a whole bunch of kids – twelve of them! Five were boys and seven were girls. Sometimes he would earn a little bit of money. One day, he felt super grumpy and left his home, leaving his wife and kids to take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34; style=&#34;--w: 1024; --h: 628;&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;A watercolor illustration of Hím, a thin barber with a worried expression, holding a worn leather razor strap and a tarnished straight razor. Dawn light filters through the cracks in the wooden walls of his dilapidated house, casting long shadows. Twelve children of varying ages, their clothes patched and faded, stand before him, their faces gaunt and their eyes reflecting hunger and sadness. His wife stands framed in the doorway, her hands on her hips, her worn apron suggesting a life of endless toil, her concerned expression etched deep into her face. Patches of faded blue paint peel from the house, revealing the rough-hewn wood beneath. Chickens peck at the dusty ground. The overall color palette leans towards muted browns, grays, and blues, evoking a sense of poverty and desperation, but with hints of early morning gold adding a touch of hope. Soft blending is used to suggest worn textures.&#34; src=&#34;https://stories.muthu.co/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-hm-and-the-tigers0.png&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;628&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a king called Manikbasa, the Ruby King, who had seven wives and seven kids. One sunny day, he told his wives he was going on a fun hunting trip! He rode his horse super far away from his fancy palace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34; style=&#34;--w: 1024; --h: 721;&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Watercolor illustration, golden hour lighting, of King Manikbasa, a strong, determined figure with a furrowed brow, adorned in ruby-red velvet clothing with intricate gold embroidery and a golden crown encrusted with sapphires. He rides a powerful, muscular white horse, its mane flowing in the wind. In the background, on the side of a dusty road with cracked earth and scattered pebbles, a sinister-looking, shadowy monster with glowing red eyes is mid-transformation into a beautiful queen with flowing dark hair and a deceptively alluring smile. The sky is a blend of orange, pink, and purple, casting long shadows. Emphasis on the contrast between the king&amp;rsquo;s vibrant colors and the monster&amp;rsquo;s dark, ominous presence. Watercolor with soft blending and natural flow.&#34; src=&#34;https://stories.muthu.co/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-brave-hrllbs0.png&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;721&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Light filters through the leaves, dappling the bird in shifting shadows and highlights. The tree has a single, prominent green bud, glistening with morning dew. The bird, with its head cocked inquisitively and feathers slightly ruffled by a gentle breeze, is looking intently at the bud with a hopeful, almost pleading expression. The background is a sun-drenched, cerulean sky with soft, blurred trees in the distance rendered in muted greens and blues. Fine watercolor details highlight the intricate bark of the cotton tree and the delicate veins of the leaves. Emotional tone: anticipation and hope.&#34; src=&#34;https://stories.muthu.co/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree0.png&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;721&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cats are like aunts to tigers, and this cat in our story was the aunt of this tiger. She was his mom&amp;rsquo;s sister! When the tiger&amp;rsquo;s mom was getting very sick, she called the cat over. She took the cat&amp;rsquo;s paw and said, &amp;ldquo;When I&amp;rsquo;m gone, please take care of my little tiger.&amp;rdquo; The cat said, &amp;ldquo;Okay, I will!&amp;rdquo; Then the tiger&amp;rsquo;s mom passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34; style=&#34;--w: 1024; --h: 680;&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;A watercolor illustration of a small, light brown cat with wide, emerald green eyes sitting next to a sick tiger (tiger&amp;rsquo;s mom) in a jungle clearing. The tiger&amp;rsquo;s mom looks weak and has matted fur; she&amp;rsquo;s lying down on a bed of damp leaves, her breathing shallow. The cat is gently holding the tiger&amp;rsquo;s mom&amp;rsquo;s paw with a concerned expression, her brow furrowed. Lush, emerald and jade foliage with broad leaves and trailing vines surrounds them. Dappled sunlight, warm and golden, filters through the trees, creating a play of light and shadow on the jungle floor. The overall tone is melancholic but hopeful, with a palette of muted greens, browns, and yellows, punctuated by the cat&amp;rsquo;s bright eyes.&#34; src=&#34;https://stories.muthu.co/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-and-the-dog0.png&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;680&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE CAT WHICH COULD NOT BE KILLED.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there were a dog and a cat who were always arguing! The dog would try to hit the cat, but he could never really hurt her. She would just dance around and shout, &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t hurt me, you can&amp;rsquo;t hurt me! My shoulder was a little sore, but now it feels all better!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34; style=&#34;--w: 1024; --h: 722;&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;A vibrant watercolor illustration of a cartoon dog and cat arguing face-to-face at golden hour. The dog, a large, fluffy golden retriever, looks intensely frustrated with teeth bared, casting a long shadow behind him. The cat, a slightly smaller calico, dances with a mischievous grin, sunlight glinting off her fur, highlighting her vibrant orange and black markings. Splatters of bright orange and yellow paint suggest the setting sun. The background is a slightly blurred, impressionistic rendering of a cozy living room with a worn wooden floor, a plush red rug, and a glimpse of a window showing a fiery sunset. The dog&amp;rsquo;s fur is textured with short, quick brushstrokes, while the cat&amp;rsquo;s fur is smoother with delicate, overlapping washes.&#34; src=&#34;https://stories.muthu.co/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed0.png&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;722&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a jackal and a kite. They lived in the same tree. The jackal lived at the bottom, and the kite lived at the top. Neither of them had any kids. One day, the kite said to the jackal, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s pray to God and not eat anything for a while. Maybe then He will give us children!&amp;rdquo; The jackal said, &amp;ldquo;Okay, good idea!&amp;rdquo; That day, the kite didn&amp;rsquo;t eat anything, not even that night. But the jackal waited until night, then secretly brought a dead animal and ate it under the tree. Crunch, crunch, crunch! The kite heard her munching on the bones instead of not eating. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s that you&amp;rsquo;ve got there?&amp;rdquo; the kite asked. &amp;ldquo;Why are you making so much noise?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s nothing,&amp;rdquo; said the jackal. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just my own bones rattling around inside me when I move!&amp;rdquo; The kite went back to sleep and didn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to the jackal. The next morning, the kite ate a little food to honor God. That night, the jackal brought another dead animal. The kite called out, &amp;ldquo;What are you crunching? Why are you making that noise? I bet you&amp;rsquo;re eating something!&amp;rdquo; The jackal said, &amp;ldquo;Oh no! It&amp;rsquo;s just my bones rattling!&amp;rdquo; So the kite went back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The man and his wife didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. Finally, the man got super mad at God. He said, &amp;ldquo;God is so unfair! He gives me lots of kids, but no money!&amp;rdquo; So, he decided to go on a trip to find his luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Queen passed away, leaving behind two little children: a girl about four or five years old, and a boy who was three. The King was very sad when she died because he loved her very much. He loved his two children a lot too! He got them two helpers: a cook to make their food, and a nanny to look after them. He also made sure they learned to read and write. Soon after his wife&amp;rsquo;s passing, the daughter of another King lost her husband. She said she would marry another King if he wanted to marry her, and she really wanted to marry the Pomegranate King! So, her father went to visit the Pomegranate King and told him that his daughter wanted to marry him. &amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get married again. If I do, the woman I marry might not be nice to my two children. She won&amp;rsquo;t take good care of them. She won&amp;rsquo;t hug them and make them feel better when they&amp;rsquo;re sad.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, but my daughter will be very good to them, I promise you,&amp;rdquo; said the other King. &amp;ldquo;Okay,&amp;rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &amp;ldquo;I will marry her.&amp;rdquo; And so, they got married.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>THE STORY OF FOOLISH SACHÚLÍ.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a poor old woman named Hungni, and she had a son named Sachuli who was a little bit silly. She had to ask people for food every day to live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;div class=&#34;img-container&#34; style=&#34;--w: 1024; --h: 721;&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Watercolor illustration. A poor, wrinkled old woman (Hungni) with weathered hands and a faded shawl sits beside a dusty ochre road under the harsh midday sun, begging with an empty chipped clay bowl. Dust motes dance in the sunbeams. Her son, Sachuli, a young man with unkempt hair and patched clothes, stands beside her, scratching his head with a confused expression and downcast eyes. Long, stark shadows stretch behind them. A single, small grey rock lies at his feet, catching the sunlight. The color palette is muted browns, grays, and yellows, creating a sense of poverty and hardship. Consistent watercolor style with soft blending and natural flow.&#34; src=&#34;https://stories.muthu.co/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-story-of-foolish-sachl0.png&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;721&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Soft, diffused sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. A determined-looking rat, fur a warm ochre brown, carries a burlap sack heavy with flour and a glass bottle of milk. The sack is dusted with flour and slightly torn. A bright green frog, with bulging eyes, hops excitedly alongside, struggling under the weight of a bundle of dry, twiggy sticks, easily taller than itself, precariously balanced on its back with twine. Dewdrops cling to the large jungle leaves. Color palette: predominantly greens and browns with accents of white, ochre, and the bright green of the frog. Creates a feeling of hopeful adventure.&#34; src=&#34;https://stories.muthu.co/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog0.png&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;722&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
