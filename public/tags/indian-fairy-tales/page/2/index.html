They let him play all day and have fun, while they worked hard to take care of him. They didn&rsquo;t teach him how to do anything, like a job or a chore. They didn&rsquo;t think about what would happen when they weren&rsquo;t around anymore, and he&rsquo;d have to take care of himself. When he was old enough, they found him a wife, and they got married. Everyone was happy for a few years, until his mom and dad sadly passed away.</p> </p>

This made the sisters-in-law super mad, and one day they teased him, &ldquo;We bet you&rsquo;ll marry a Bél-Princess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young prince thought to himself, &ldquo;A Bél-Princess? What&rsquo;s that? And where do you find one? I&rsquo;m going to go look for her!&rdquo; But the next day, he wondered, &ldquo;How am I supposed to find a Bél-Princess? I don&rsquo;t even know where to start!&rdquo;</p> </p>

A young gardener&rsquo;s daughter, around 8 years old, with rosy cheeks and braided brown hair, beams with a genuine, gap-toothed smile. She points upwards with a dirty, soil-stained finger towards a bird&rsquo;s nest high in the branches. Seven other young girls, ranging in age, giggle and laugh with amusement, their faces flushed with joy. Some wear simple cotton dresses, others patched and worn clothing. A worn, hand-painted watering can rests near the base of the tree. Wildflowers bloom riotously in the foreground, creating a vibrant carpet of color.

He wears simple, patched earth-toned clothing, a coarse linen shirt barely covering his ribs. Above him, hanging precariously from a rusty hook on the whitewashed wall, is a large, rustic clay pot overflowing with glistening white rice. A single shaft of moonlight, piercing through a crack in the wooden shutters, illuminates the pot, casting long, dramatic shadows across the room. He gazes up at the pot with wide, greedy eyes that reflect the moonlight, a faint, almost manic smile playing on his thin lips. The room is dimly lit, the color palette muted grays and browns, emphasizing the golden glow of the rice as the focal point, contrasting with the poverty of the setting.

The cat is gently holding the tiger&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s paw with a concerned expression, her brow furrowed. Lush, emerald and jade foliage with broad leaves and trailing vines surrounds them.

Splatters of bright orange and yellow paint suggest the setting sun. The background is a slightly blurred, impressionistic rendering of a cozy living room with a worn wooden floor, a plush red rug, and a glimpse of a window showing a fiery sunset.

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration, late afternoon golden hour. A weary farmer with ragged, patched clothes stained with earth stands in front of the ornate, sun-drenched house of a plump and richly dressed money lender. The money lender&rsquo;s house boasts intricately carved wooden doors and vibrant, blooming jasmine climbing its walls. The farmer, face etched with worry and sweat glistening on his brow, gestures with open, trembling hands in desperation. Long shadows stretch from the farmer and the house. The color palette is warm, with oranges and yellows dominating, but a somber gray clinging to the farmer. Texture: rough, woven mat outside the money lender&rsquo;s door, contrasting with the smoothness of the farmer&rsquo;s calloused hands." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-farmer-and-the-money-lender0.png" width="1024" height="680">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Haridatta, a weary farmer in his late 50s, with a deeply lined, sun-kissed brown face etched with years of labor and worry. He wears simple, patched brown homespun clothing. He&rsquo;s napping fitfully under the sprawling, gnarled branches of a colossal banyan tree in a golden wheat field, the wheat swaying gently in the breeze. The late afternoon sun casts long, dappled shadows across the field. A large, imposing cobra with scales that shimmer with subtle iridescence and a proudly raised hood is emerging from a small, crumbling earthen mound near the tree roots. The mound is covered in dry, cracked earth and scattered pebbles. The air is thick with the scent of dry grass and warm earth. Color palette is warm golds, browns, and greens, creating a feeling of peaceful weariness." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-gold-giving-serpent0.png" width="1024" height="721">

Golden sunlight casts long shadows, highlighting the prince&rsquo;s focused expression as he aims an arrow. The prince wears a tunic of deep green with gold trim, while his friend, in a simple brown tunic, stands beside him, smiling and holding a polished wooden bow. An arrow streaks through the air towards a distant, multi-paned window of a nearby castle, leaving a faint blur trail. The lush grass is dotted with wildflowers in shades of yellow and purple.

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>Once upon a time, there was a jackal and a kite. They lived in the same tree. The jackal lived at the bottom, and the kite lived at the top. Neither of them had any kids. One day, the kite said to the jackal, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pray to God and not eat anything for a while. Maybe then He will give us children!&rdquo; The jackal said, &ldquo;Okay, good idea!&rdquo; That day, the kite didn&rsquo;t eat anything, not even that night. But the jackal waited until night, then secretly brought a dead animal and ate it under the tree. Crunch, crunch, crunch! The kite heard her munching on the bones instead of not eating. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got there?&rdquo; the kite asked. &ldquo;Why are you making so much noise?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said the jackal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just my own bones rattling around inside me when I move!&rdquo; The kite went back to sleep and didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the jackal. The next morning, the kite ate a little food to honor God. That night, the jackal brought another dead animal. The kite called out, &ldquo;What are you crunching? Why are you making that noise? I bet you&rsquo;re eating something!&rdquo; The jackal said, &ldquo;Oh no! It&rsquo;s just my bones rattling!&rdquo; So the kite went back to sleep.</p> </p>

Sunlight dappled with long shadows dances through the leaves of towering oak trees in the background, creating a sense of whimsical joy. The Lambikin has a joyous expression on its face, its wool catching the sunlight and appearing almost translucent. Soft watercolor blending gives the impression of gentle movement. The grass is a vibrant green with subtle yellow undertones, and tiny wildflowers bloom along the edge of the path.

They point dramatically at a young woman with a cracked clay jar, water spilling from its side. A small, mischievous-looking Bonga, with large, iridescent eyes, lurks nearby, partially obscured by swaying reeds. The sky is a pale cerulean blue with soft, cumulus clouds, casting a dappled light on the scene.
