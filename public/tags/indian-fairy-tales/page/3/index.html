<p>Once upon a time, there was a King called the Pomegranate King, and a Queen called the Pomegranate Flower. The Queen passed away, leaving behind two little children: a girl about four or five years old, and a boy who was three. The King was very sad when she died because he loved her very much. He loved his two children a lot too! He got them two helpers: a cook to make their food, and a nanny to look after them. He also made sure they learned to read and write. Soon after his wife&rsquo;s passing, the daughter of another King lost her husband. She said she would marry another King if he wanted to marry her, and she really wanted to marry the Pomegranate King! So, her father went to visit the Pomegranate King and told him that his daughter wanted to marry him. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get married again. If I do, the woman I marry might not be nice to my two children. She won&rsquo;t take good care of them. She won&rsquo;t hug them and make them feel better when they&rsquo;re sad.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, but my daughter will be very good to them, I promise you,&rdquo; said the other King. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &ldquo;I will marry her.&rdquo; And so, they got married.</p> </p>
