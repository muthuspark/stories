The rose is depicted wilting and losing its color in the background, while in the foreground, a small bird drinks water from the cactus. Use a warm, desert color palette. The rose and cactus should maintain consistent size and shape across all elements of the painting, with the rose being noticeably larger and more detailed than the other plants, and the cactus having a consistent shape and texture." src="/images/image_the-proud-rose0.png" width="1024" height="766">

The foreground should depict the same rose bush, now wilted and dull, reaching towards the cactus for water, which is depicted as plump and verdant. The bird should be small and brown to provide a contrast in size and color.

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a split scene. On the left, a cheerful, bright pink rose bush with large, detailed petals mocks a stoic green cactus in a vibrant desert setting. On the right, depict the same rose bush, now withered and brown, humbly receiving water from the same cactus. The cactus should be a consistent light green color, while the rose is a saturated pink in the first half and a faded brown in the second.  The rose and cactus should have consistent shapes and sizes throughout both scenes. A small bird subtly interacts with the cactus on the right to emphasize the water source." src="/images/image_the-proud-rose2.png" width="1024" height="766">

<p>Once upon a time, in a faraway desert, there was a beautiful rose bush.  This rose was very proud of its pretty petals and lovely color.  Its only complaint was that it grew next to a prickly cactus, which it thought was very ugly.</p>
<p>Every day, the beautiful rose would tease and make fun of the cactus.  The cactus, however, never said a word.  The other plants tried to tell the rose to be kind, but the rose was too busy admiring itself.</p>
<p>One day, a terrible drought hit the desert.  There was no water for any of the plants.  The rose began to wilt.  Its pretty petals dried up, and it lost its bright color.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the rose saw a little bird dip its beak into the cactus to drink some water! The rose felt a little bit ashamed.</p>
<p>Even though it was embarrassed, the rose asked the cactus if it could have some water too. The kind cactus happily agreed! The rose realized its mistake.  From that day on, the rose and the cactus helped each other through the hot desert days.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Never judge anyone by how they look. You never know when someone might be able to help you!</p>
