<p>A long, long time ago, there was a huge circus!  Lots of animals did amazing tricks.</p>
<p>There was a group of elephants who were super good at their tricks and made everyone happy.</p>
<p>One day, five elephants performed their tricks.  After their show, they were tied up with weak ropes.  The ropes were so easy to break, but the elephants never tried!</p>
<p>One day, a man watching the circus asked the ringmaster, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the elephants break the ropes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ringmaster explained, &ldquo;When the elephants were babies, they were tied with thin ropes.  They were too little to break free, no matter how hard they tried.</p>
<p>Slowly, they stopped trying. They started to believe they couldn&rsquo;t escape.  They were made to believe they weren&rsquo;t strong enough to break the ropes and run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, even when they grew big and strong, they were still tied with easy-to-break ropes.  They never even tried to break free because they believed they couldn&rsquo;t.  They could easily break the ropes in a second, but they didn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> We should always try to break free from limits and never believe everything we hear. We should always question and try to find out the truth for ourselves.</p>
