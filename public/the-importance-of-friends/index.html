        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a heartwarming summer scene. Golu, a boy with bright orange shirt and dark hair, is surrounded by five friends, each with distinct clothing colors (one blue, one green, one yellow, one purple, one red) but similar size and simple shapes,  in a vibrant mango orchard. Lush green mango trees laden with ripe yellow mangoes fill the background. In the foreground, Golu is shown twice: once playfully eating a mango alone, and smaller in the next section, where he is helped up by his friends after a fall. Use soft, gentle watercolor washes to depict happiness and care.  Focus on conveying the story&rsquo;s emotional arc from selfishness to sharing." src="/images/image_the-importance-of-friends0.png" width="1024" height="723">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting the story of Golu.  Golu (orange shirt, dark hair) is a consistently sized and shaped character throughout the painting, as are his five friends (distinct clothing colors as above).  One panel shows Golu happily, but selfishly, eating mangoes alone under a mango tree, rendered in warm, sunny yellows and oranges. Another panel shows him injured, receiving help from his friends who are expressing concern through their body language.  A third panel depicts Golu’s mother (wearing a light blue sari) tending to his wound,  with his five friends happily eating mangoes offered by his mother. Use cool blues and greens to contrast with the warmer earlier scenes, reflecting the shift in Golu&rsquo;s behavior." src="/images/image_the-importance-of-friends1.png" width="722" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor storybook page illustrating Golu&rsquo;s experience. Use a consistent painterly style throughout. Golu (orange shirt, dark hair), consistent in size and shape, is shown in three distinct scenes.  Scene 1: Golu surrounded by his five friends (distinct colours as above),  but separately munching a large mango, set against a sunny orchard. Scene 2: Golu (smaller) is shown injured, his friends helping him, the scene toned down in brightness. Scene 3:  Golu happily shares mangoes with his friends, under a tree, radiating warmth and friendship. Use a palette of vibrant summer colours but with subtly shifting tones to reflect the story’s emotional changes.  The background should be simple but evocative of a mango orchard." src="/images/image_the-importance-of-friends2.png" width="1024" height="510">

<p>Golu went to his grandmother&rsquo;s house during the summer holidays. He had a lot of fun because his grandmother had a mango orchard! Golu ate lots and lots of mangoes and played all day. He had five friends, but he didn&rsquo;t share his mangoes with them.</p>
<p>One day, while playing, Golu hurt himself. His friends helped him up and took him home. They told Golu&rsquo;s mom what happened. Golu&rsquo;s mom put medicine on his boo-boo and gave him a massage.</p>
<p>She thanked his friends and gave them lots of yummy mangoes to eat.  When Golu got better, he understood how important his friends were.  From then on, he played with them and shared his mangoes happily.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Friends are there for you when you&rsquo;re happy and when you&rsquo;re sad.  We should love our friends and not keep secrets from them.</p>
