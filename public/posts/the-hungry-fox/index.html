        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene. A chubby orange fox with small, pointed ears and a bushy tail, is standing beneath a vine laden with big, juicy purple grapes. The grapes hang from a grey stone wall that is slightly textured and mossy at the base.  The background depicts a soft-focused watercolor wash of a green forest. The fox has a determined yet slightly comical expression as he attempts (unsuccessfully) to reach the high-hanging grapes. The style should be loose and expressive, emphasizing the texture of the wall, the juicy grapes, and the fox&rsquo;s fur using watercolor washes and splashes of color. The fox should maintain a consistent size, shape and coloration throughout the painting." src="/posts/images/image_the-hungry-fox2.png" width="1024" height="948">

<p>Once upon a time, in a big forest, there lived a very hungry fox.  He searched and searched for food, but he couldn&rsquo;t find anything to eat! He looked high and low, but his tummy was still rumbling.</p>
<p>Finally, his tummy rumbled so loud, he bumped into a farmer&rsquo;s wall!  He climbed to the top and saw a bunch of big, juicy grapes hanging there.  They looked so fresh and yummy! The fox thought, &ldquo;Those grapes are perfect for my empty tummy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grapes were high up, so the fox had to jump to reach them. He leaped and opened his mouth wide, but he missed! He tried again, but he missed again!  He tried and tried, but he just couldn&rsquo;t reach them.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 814;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration showing a sequence of three moments: 1) The hungry, orange fox with small pointed ears and a bushy tail searching amongst overgrown green foliage, looking sad and thin. 2) The same fox attempting to reach a bunch of plump purple grapes hanging from a low stone wall, his body slightly stretched upward,  in a bright sunny spot within a forest. 3) The fox walking away, his head down, in the shade of the same forest, looking disgruntled. Keep the fox&rsquo;s size and color consistent throughout, using a light, airy watercolor technique to show movement and emotion." src="/posts/images/image_the-hungry-fox1.png" width="1024" height="814">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>At last, the fox decided to give up.  As he walked away, he grumbled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure those grapes were sour anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> We should always try our best, and not make excuses when we don&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
