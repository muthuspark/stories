        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a heartwarming scene: A kind golden goose with shimmering, detailed feathers, slightly larger than a human child, gently presents a single golden feather to a smiling, wrinkled old woman and her two younger daughters. The woman and girls are dressed in simple, muted earth-toned clothes.  The lake is in the background, subtly reflecting the golden light.  Use a soft, warm color palette, focusing on the gentle contrast between the goose&rsquo;s bright feathers and the subdued clothing of the women.  The overall feeling should be one of kindness and generosity." src="/posts/images/image_the-golden-goose0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>A long, long time ago, there was a beautiful goose with shiny golden feathers living in a lake. Near the lake lived a poor old woman and her two daughters.  They worked very hard, but they were still very poor.</p>
<p>One day, the golden goose thought, &ldquo;I should give the old woman a golden feather.  She can sell it and have enough money!&rdquo; So, the next day, the goose flew to the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to give you!&rdquo; cried the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have something for you!&rdquo; said the kind goose, and explained his plan.</p>
<p>The old woman loved the idea! The next day, she and her daughters went to market and sold the feather. They came home happy with lots of money!</p>
<p>Day after day, the kind goose helped the family. The daughters loved to play with the goose, and they took good care of him, especially during rainy and cold days.</p>
<p>But as time passed, the old woman became greedy. &ldquo;One feather isn&rsquo;t enough!&rdquo; she told her daughters.  &ldquo;We need more! Tomorrow, when the goose comes, we&rsquo;ll take all his feathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her daughters didn&rsquo;t like this idea, but the old woman insisted.</p>
<p>The next day, the old woman waited for the goose. When he arrived, she grabbed him and started pulling out his feathers.  As she pulled, the golden feathers turned white!</p>
<p>The old woman cried. She let the goose go.</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration:  The central focus is a distressed golden goose, its feathers now dull white, with a few remaining golden feathers clinging to its body. The old woman, her face etched with regret, clutches a pile of white feathers, her daughters looking on sadly. The background depicts a gloomy, grey lake with dark, stormy clouds. The palette should be cool and muted, with a touch of faded gold to represent the lost glory. The style should be expressive, highlighting the emotions of the characters." src="/posts/images/image_the-golden-goose1.png" width="1024" height="1024">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;You became greedy!&rdquo; said the goose.  &ldquo;You took my feathers without my permission, so they turned white!&rdquo;  The angry goose flew away and was never seen again.</p>
<p><strong>The moral of the story:</strong>  Greed causes a lot of harm. We should be happy with what we have and work hard to get more, but not be greedy!</p>
