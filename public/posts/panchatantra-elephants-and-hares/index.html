        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a dramatic moment: The elephant king, a larger grey elephant consistent in shape and size,  bows deeply before the lake, his reflection mirroring his humbled posture.  Smaller brown bunnies, consistent in size and shape, watch from a nearby burrow, appearing relieved and safe.  The lake&rsquo;s surface is tranquil, reflecting a bright, full moon. The background shows the partially dried-up original pond and the lush green jungle.   Use contrasting color temperatures; cool blues and silvers for the water and moon, and warm earthy tones for the jungle and elephants. The overall mood should convey relief and the power of cleverness." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-elephants-and-hares2.png" width="731" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, deep in the jungle, lived a big family of elephants near a pond.  They were happy there, but then the pond started to dry up because it hadn&rsquo;t rained in a long time.</p>
<p>Some elephants told their king, &ldquo;We need more water!  The baby elephants are thirsty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king said, &ldquo;I remember a big, big lake far away. Let&rsquo;s go there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, the elephants walked for five days and five nights!  Finally, they found the lake. It was full of water!</p>
<p>But&hellip; near the lake lived lots of little bunnies in their cozy burrows.</p>
<p>The elephants were so happy to see the water, they jumped and splashed.  Oops!  They accidentally squished some bunny burrows!  Many bunnies got hurt.</p>
<p>When the elephants left, the bunnies were sad.  &ldquo;The elephants will come back!&rdquo; they cried.  &ldquo;We need to do something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One brave bunny said,  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re small, but we can be clever! I have a plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bunny sat on a little hill near the lake.  When the elephant king came back, the bunny shouted, &ldquo;Stop! This lake belongs to the Moon! You can&rsquo;t come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant king was scared. He didn&rsquo;t want to make the Moon angry.</p>
<p>The bunny said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Moon&rsquo;s messenger!  The Moon saw you hurt the bunnies.  Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant king asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Moon? I want to say sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clever bunny pointed to the lake. &ldquo;The Moon is in the water!  See? Bow down and be quiet. Don&rsquo;t bother him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant king saw the moon&rsquo;s reflection in the water. He was amazed!  He bowed, and he and his family left quickly.</p>
<p>The bunnies were safe!  Even small animals can be very clever and brave.</p>
