Near the tree, a dark cave mouth is visible, with several brown owls perched near the entrance, one larger owl representing King Arimaradana.  A small, wise-looking brown owl (Sthirajeevi) is shown separately, appearing both near the crows and the owls, subtly suggesting his movement between the two groups.  The background is a soft wash of purples and oranges suggesting sunset, with the Rshyamukam Mountain faintly visible in the distance as a silhouette.

<p>Once upon a time, near a city, lived a big banyan tree.  Lots and lots of crows lived in its branches!  Their king was named Meghavarana.</p>
<p>Nearby was a cave where many owls lived.  Their king was Arimaradana. The owls were mean; they hated the crows and would attack them at night.</p>
<p>King Meghavarana called a meeting with his five ministers.  &ldquo;The owls are hurting us,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His ministers gave different ideas:  Some said to make peace, some said to run away, and some said to fight.</p>
<p>But the king wasn&rsquo;t happy. He asked an old, wise minister named Sthirajeevi for help.</p>
<p>Sthirajeevi had a clever plan.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll trick the owls!&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Pretend I&rsquo;m a traitor.  Make it look like I&rsquo;m fighting with you, then fly away to the Rshyamukam Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crows followed the plan. They pretended to fight with Sthirajeevi and then flew away.  The owl spies told their king.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sthirajeevi went to the owls. He pretended to be friendly, telling them he hated the crows and knew where they hid. The owls took him in.</p>
<p>Secretly, Sthirajeevi gathered lots of twigs near the owl&rsquo;s cave entrance. Then, he secretly flew back to the crows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a big pile of twigs,&rdquo; Sthirajeevi said.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set it on fire!&rdquo;  The crows did, and all the owls were safe!</p>
<p>The crows went back to their banyan tree, and everyone lived happily ever after.  Remember: Never trust your enemies!</p>
