        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: A slender, tan-colored jackal, Gomaya, with expressive brown eyes, is depicted cautiously approaching a large, dark brown drum in the foreground. The drum sits in a battlefield setting, rendered in muted greens, browns, and greys.  Dried leaves and twigs are scattered around the drum and food items, such as berries and a small pool of water, are visible near it. The sky is a soft, pale watercolor wash of blue and grey. The emphasis should be on the contrast between Gomaya&rsquo;s timid approach and the abundance of food he discovers." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-jackal-and-drum1.png" width="1024" height="715">

<p>Gomaya the jackal was very, very hungry!  He was looking for food everywhere.</p>
<p>He walked and walked, right out of the jungle and into an old battlefield.  A big battle had happened there a long time ago.</p>
<p>Gomaya saw a big drum lying near a tree.  Whoosh! The wind blew, and the tree branches bumped against the drum.  <em>Boom, boom!</em>  It made a scary noise!</p>
<p>Gomaya was scared! He wanted to run away.  &ldquo;Maybe someone is making that noise!&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>But then Gomaya thought again.  &ldquo;Maybe I should see what&rsquo;s making that noise first!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He slowly, slowly crept closer.  He looked and looked.  It was just the wind! The wind was making the drum make noise.</p>
<p>Gomaya was so happy!  Near the drum, he found lots of yummy food and water!  He wasn&rsquo;t hungry anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always good to be brave and find out what&rsquo;s happening before you run away!</p>
