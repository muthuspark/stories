        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a small, vibrant bulbul bird perched expectantly on a branch of a cotton tree under the warm, golden light of late morning. Light filters through the leaves, dappling the bird in shifting shadows and highlights. The tree has a single, prominent green bud, glistening with morning dew. The bird, with its head cocked inquisitively and feathers slightly ruffled by a gentle breeze, is looking intently at the bud with a hopeful, almost pleading expression. The background is a sun-drenched, cerulean sky with soft, blurred trees in the distance rendered in muted greens and blues. Fine watercolor details highlight the intricate bark of the cotton tree and the delicate veins of the leaves. Emotional tone: anticipation and hope." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree0.png" width="1024" height="721">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a little bulbul bird. One sunny day, as he was flying around, he spotted a tree with something small on it. The bulbul was super excited! &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wait right here until that thing is ready to eat!&rdquo; he chirped. So, he left his cozy nest and his wife, and he stayed on that tree for twelve whole years! He didn&rsquo;t eat anything else. Every day, he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll finally eat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 738;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the bulbul bird perched on the same branch, now with a bright, intensely red cotton flower in full bloom, radiating a vibrant energy. The bulbul has a joyful expression, beak slightly open as if singing a triumphant melody. Sunlight glints off its iridescent feathers. Other birds, including sparrows and finches, are approaching the tree in the background, silhouettes against the brilliant blue sky. The bulbul is shooing them away with a raised wing, a possessive glint in its eye and a determined stance. The background trees are slightly more defined than the previous scene, adding a sense of depth. The overall color palette is bright and cheerful, evoking a feeling of elation and territoriality. Artistic style: Loose watercolor with visible brushstrokes and intentional blending." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree1.png" width="1024" height="738">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>While he was waiting, lots of other birds wanted to hang out on the tree and build their own nests. But whenever they came near, the bulbul would shoo them away. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good for you!&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, a cuckoo bird flew over and asked, &ldquo;Why are you chasing us away? Why can&rsquo;t we sit here too? This whole place isn&rsquo;t yours!&rdquo; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; the bulbul huffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying right here, and when this is ready, I&rsquo;m going to eat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 573;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the bulbul bird looking confused and slightly worried at a large, open cotton pod bursting with fluffy white cotton under the diffused, overcast light of early autumn. The air feels cooler, hinted at by the slightly desaturated colors. The cotton pod is realistically rendered with individual fibers of cotton spilling outwards. The cuckoo bird is observing him from a nearby, gnarled branch, its feathers looking slightly puffed up for warmth, with a knowing, almost smug look on its face. The background features a softer, more muted color palette to reflect the changing season, with browns, oranges, and grays dominating. The bird&rsquo;s feathers are depicted in more detail, showing subtle color variations. Emotional tone: Confusion and slight apprehension." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree2.png" width="1024" height="573">
    </div>

</p>
<p>Now, the cuckoo knew that this was a cotton tree, but the bulbul didn&rsquo;t. First, there was a little bud, which the bulbul thought was yummy. Then, a pretty flower bloomed! After that, the flower turned into a big pod. And then, the pod popped open, and all the fluffy cotton floated away!</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 818;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the disappointed bulbul bird looking into the empty cotton pod under the somber light of a late afternoon. Long shadows stretch across the scene, creating a sense of emptiness. Fluffy cotton is drifting away in the breeze, catching the last rays of the setting sun. A group of colorful birds, including mockingbirds and robins, are gathered nearby, chirping and laughing at the bulbul, their voices seeming mocking in the quiet air. The cuckoo bird stands slightly apart, perched on a broken branch, a gentle, almost empathetic expression on its face. Individual blades of grass are visible in the foreground, adding texture to the scene. Emotional tone: Disappointment and vulnerability." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree3.png" width="1024" height="818">

</p>
<p>The bulbul was so happy when he saw the bright red flower. He still thought it was a yummy snack! &ldquo;When that&rsquo;s ready, it&rsquo;s going to be the best thing ever!&rdquo; he sang. But then, the flower became a pod, and the pod burst open! &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this stuff flying around?&rdquo; the bulbul wondered. &ldquo;It must be ready now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the bulbul bird perched on the cotton tree, looking angrily at the trunk under the harsh, unforgiving light of a midday sun. The tree&rsquo;s branches are laden with open cotton pods, each one overflowing with fluffy white cotton, mocking the bird&rsquo;s earlier hope. The background shows a flock of birds flying away into a bright, fiery, and colorful sunset, their silhouettes stark against the vibrant sky. The bulbul&rsquo;s feathers are ruffled in anger, and its beak is slightly open in a silent scream. The overall color palette is harsh and contrasting, reflecting the bird&rsquo;s internal turmoil. Artistic style: Bold watercolor with strong contrasts and dynamic brushstrokes." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree4.png" width="1024" height="1024">

</p>
<p>He peeked into the pod, but it was empty! All the cotton was gone. Just then, the cuckoo flew over and said to the grumpy bulbul, &ldquo;See? If you had let us share the tree, you might have had something yummy to eat! But because you were selfish and didn&rsquo;t want to share, now you have nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 793;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration showing a field of sheep peacefully grazing on white cotton flowers under a clear blue sky. The sheep have soft, woolly textures, each rendered with subtle watercolor techniques. In the background, a family sleeps comfortably on a bed with white pillows and a cotton mattress in a brightly lit bedroom. Sunlight streams through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A cotton tree stands in the distance, partially silhouetted by the warm, golden light of the evening sky. The illustration evokes a feeling of peace, comfort, and contentment. Details include a rocking chair next to the bed and a small wooden nightstand with a lit oil lamp. Emotional tone: Serenity and domestic bliss." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree5.png" width="1024" height="793">

</p>
<p>The cuckoo called all the other birds, and they all flew over and teased the bulbul. &ldquo;Ha ha!&rdquo; they chirped. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you get for being so selfish!&rdquo; The bulbul got very mad, and all the birds flew away.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 573;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a solitary bulbul bird flying away from a cotton tree silhouetted by a golden, melancholic sunset. The bird looks back at the tree, a mix of regret and understanding on its face, etched with delicate watercolor lines. Other birds are perched happily on the branches of the cotton tree, their silhouettes sharply defined against the fiery sky. The landscape below is rendered in muted tones, creating a sense of vastness and isolation. The overall color palette is warm and nostalgic, evoking a feeling of reflection and acceptance. The sunset is painted with flowing watercolor washes, creating a stunning and ethereal effect. Emotional tone: Regret, understanding, and loneliness." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree6.png" width="1024" height="573">

</p>
<p>After they left, the bulbul grumbled at the tree. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a terrible tree! You&rsquo;re not useful to anyone! You don&rsquo;t give food to anyone!&rdquo; The tree replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true! God made me this way. My flowers are food for sheep! And my cotton makes soft pillows and comfy mattresses for people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 710; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the cotton tree, now a thriving ecosystem, with many birds nesting and sitting on its branches. The birds are all different species – robins, blue jays, cardinals, wrens – and are interacting peacefully, some building nests, others preening their feathers. The pods are bursting with cotton and the sky is a bright, sunny blue with soft, puffy clouds. The tree itself is full of life, with vibrant green leaves and intricate branches. The scene is bathed in warm, inviting sunlight, creating a feeling of joy and harmony. Details include various nests of twigs and leaves, some containing eggs, and the branches bending with the weight of life. The overall impression is one of abundance and interconnectedness. Artistic style: detailed watercolor with rich colors and intricate details. Emotional tone: Harmony, abundance, and peace." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-bulbul-and-the-cotton-tree7.png" width="710" height="1024">
