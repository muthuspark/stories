<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor cart maker named Ujjwalaka.  He didn&rsquo;t have many customers, so he was very sad. He didn&rsquo;t have a nice house, nice clothes, or even enough food!  He decided to leave town to find a better life.</p>
<p>He traveled through a jungle and saw a mama camel who was very sick. She was all alone because her caravan had left her. Ujjwalaka gave her water and yummy grass to eat.  Soon, she got better and had a baby camel!</p>
<p>Ujjwalaka took the mama and baby camel home with him. They became his new family! The baby camel grew big and strong. Ujjwalaka put a pretty bell around its neck.</p>
<p>He sold the mama camel&rsquo;s milk and made enough money to take care of his own family.  He even bought more camels!  Soon he had lots and lots of camels!</p>
<p>He even hired a helper to take care of them. The helper got a baby camel every year as a thank you. Ujjwalaka was very rich and happy.</p>
<p>His favorite camel was the one with the bell.  He loved the jingle-jingle sound it made!  Every day the camels went to the jungle to eat grass and drink water from a big lake.  They played and had fun.</p>
<p>But the bell camel was a bit silly. He always lagged behind the others. The other camels told him to stay close, but he was too proud. He liked wandering off by himself.</p>
<p>One day, a scary lion came! The lion heard the bell and followed the silly camel, who was far away from the others.  Before the camel could even shout, the lion caught him.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor scene depicting a dramatic moment: a large, menacing lion, rendered in dark oranges and yellows, lunging at a single, slightly smaller tan camel with a golden bell, who is separated from the rest of the herd. The scene should highlight the danger and the camel&rsquo;s isolation, set against the backdrop of a darker, more shadowy jungle.  Maintain consistency in the camel&rsquo;s depiction with previous prompts." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-price-of-indiscretion2.png" width="1024" height="559">
