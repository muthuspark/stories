<p>Once upon a time, a king&rsquo;s elephant was eating grass near a small hill.  He heard a hungry little sound.</p>
<p>It was a dog eating leftover food from the elephant keeper&rsquo;s plate. The keeper wasn&rsquo;t around.  The elephant was used to being alone, so he didn&rsquo;t mind the dog at first.</p>
<p>Soon, the elephant and the dog became best friends and played together all the time! The keeper didn&rsquo;t mind either.</p>
<p>One day, a farmer saw the dog and asked the keeper if he could have him. Since the dog wasn&rsquo;t the keeper&rsquo;s, he said yes and gave the dog away.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 958; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="The king&rsquo;s blue elephant and the hungry red labrador dog become fast friends, playing together in the sunshine as the keeper looks on with a smile." src="/posts/images/image_the-elephant-and-the-dog1000.png" width="958" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>Without his friend, the elephant became very sad. He stopped eating, drinking, and playing. He just stayed on the hill and wouldn&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>The king came to visit his elephant and saw how sad and sick he looked. The elephant wasn&rsquo;t eating or doing anything!</p>
<p>The king called the royal doctor.  The doctor checked the elephant and said, &ldquo;Your Majesty, the elephant is perfectly healthy, but it seems he&rsquo;s lost a friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king called the keeper and asked what happened. The keeper said, &ldquo;Oh, there was a dog here. I gave him away to a farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king sent a guard to bring the dog back. As soon as the dog was brought back to the hill, the elephant saw his little friend, got very happy, and started playing again!</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A heartwarming scene shows the blue elephant and the red labrador dog playing together once more, this time with the king watching proudly from the sidelines, surrounded by lush greenery." src="/posts/images/image_the-elephant-and-the-dog400.png" width="1024" height="722">
    </div>

</p>
<p>From that day on, the elephant and the dog were even better friends. Their friendship was very strong.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> We should care for our friends, and true friendship lasts forever.</p>
