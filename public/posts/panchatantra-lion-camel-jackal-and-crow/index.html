<p>Long ago, in a jungle, lived a lion named Madotkata. He had friends: a leopard, a jackal, a crow, and many other animals.</p>
<p>One day, they saw a camel!  The camel was lost from its family.  Madotkata wanted to meet this new animal.</p>
<p>The crow, who had traveled far, said, &ldquo;Master, that&rsquo;s a camel!  They live in villages. Their meat is tasty! Let&rsquo;s eat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Madotkata said, &ldquo;No!  The camel isn&rsquo;t from the jungle. It&rsquo;s our guest!  Be kind to it, and bring it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animals brought the lost camel to Madotkata. The camel bowed and told Madotkata how it got lost.</p>
<p>Madotkata said, &ldquo;Camel, you&rsquo;ll have to carry heavy loads in the village. Stay here in the jungle with me. You can eat all the yummy grass you want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camel stayed, and they all lived happily. But then, Madotkata got hurt in a fight with a big, angry elephant!</p>
<p>Madotkata couldn&rsquo;t hunt. He and his animal friends got very hungry.  Madotkata said, &ldquo;Find me an animal I can eat, so we all have food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animals searched, but found nothing.  The sneaky jackal had an idea.</p>
<p>He whispered to the crow, &ldquo;The camel! We can eat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crow said, &ldquo;But the lion promised to protect the camel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jackal said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll convince the lion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jackal told Madotkata, &ldquo;Master, we found no food!  If you eat the camel, we&rsquo;ll all have enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madotkata said, &ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not right! I promised the camel it would be safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the jackal tricked Madotkata. He said, &ldquo;If the camel offers itself, it&rsquo;s okay to eat it.&rdquo; He even suggested the lion eat one of them instead to avoid breaking the promise.</p>
<p>The jackal told the other animals, &ldquo;The lion is sick.  To repay him, let&rsquo;s offer ourselves as food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the animals went to Madotkata and offered themselves. But Madotkata refused!</p>
<p>The camel watched. It thought, &ldquo;They are all meat-eaters like the lion.  I will offer myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camel said, &ldquo;Master, eat me! I&rsquo;ll go to a good place in the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other animals were happy. The lion, tricked by the jackal, ate the camel.</p>
<p>The story teaches us: Be careful around tricky people! Don&rsquo;t believe everything they say!</p>
