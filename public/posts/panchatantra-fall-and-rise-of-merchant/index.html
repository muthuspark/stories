<p>Once upon a time, in the city of Vardhamana, lived a very rich and helpful merchant.  He was so good at his job that the king made him run the whole kingdom! Everyone loved him, and the king was very happy.</p>
<p>Then, the merchant&rsquo;s daughter got married. He threw a HUGE party!  He invited the king, queen, and everyone important.  He gave everyone yummy food and wonderful gifts.</p>
<p>But, a palace cleaner wasn&rsquo;t invited, but he came anyway! He sat in a special seat only for important people. The merchant was very upset and asked his helpers to send the cleaner away.</p>
<p>The cleaner felt sad and wanted revenge. He thought, &ldquo;How can I make the king dislike the merchant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Days later, the cleaner was sweeping near the king&rsquo;s bed. The king was sleepy. The cleaner whispered, &ldquo;The merchant hugged the queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king woke up! &ldquo;Is that true? Did you see it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The cleaner quickly said, &ldquo;Oh, I was up all night playing games! I&rsquo;m sleepy and talking silly. Please forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the king wasn&rsquo;t sure. He started to think the cleaner might be telling the truth.</p>
<p>The king became angry with the merchant and wouldn&rsquo;t let him near the palace. The merchant was very confused.</p>
<p>The cleaner saw the merchant was sad and laughed. He shouted to the guards, &ldquo;That merchant is powerful! He can get anyone in trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant knew the cleaner had caused his problems.  He thought carefully and invited the cleaner to his house. He gave the cleaner many nice gifts and apologized. He said, &ldquo;I was wrong to send you away, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have sat in that special seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cleaner felt happy and said, &ldquo;I forgive you! I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, the cleaner was sweeping near the king&rsquo;s bed again.  When the king was sleepy, he whispered, &ldquo;The king eats cucumbers in the bathroom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king shouted, &ldquo;What?! That&rsquo;s silly!&rdquo;  The cleaner again said he was just sleepy and talking nonsense.</p>
<p>The king thought, &ldquo;If the cleaner is lying about me, maybe he lied about the merchant too!&rdquo;  The king remembered how well the merchant ran the kingdom.</p>
<p>The king invited the merchant back and gave him lots of gifts.  He was happy to have him back.</p>
<p>The story teaches us: Always be kind and respectful to everyone!</p>
