<p>Once upon a time, near a big mountain, lived a very old snake named Mandavishya. He was so old he couldn&rsquo;t catch frogs to eat!  He thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too weak to hunt. I need a new plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a clever idea. He went to a pond full of frogs and pretended to be sleepy. He didn&rsquo;t try to catch any.</p>
<p>At first, the frogs were scared, but Mandavishya was so still, they got brave and hopped closer. One frog asked, &ldquo;Mr. Snake, why aren&rsquo;t you hunting us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mandavishya said, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very unlucky! I accidentally bit a boy, and a magical man made me promise to only help frogs! I&rsquo;ll give anyone a ride on my back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frog king heard about this and wanted a ride!  Mandavishya gave him a fun ride around the pond. All the frogs loved it!  Mandavishya showed off his cool crawling moves. Everyone had a great time!</p>
<p>The next day, Mandavishya pretended to be very weak.  The frog king asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired! I need to eat to be strong enough to give you rides,&rdquo; said Mandavishya.</p>
<p>The kind frog king decided to give Mandavishya one frog each day to help him get stronger.  That was exactly what Mandavishya wanted! He gave more fun rides.</p>
<p>Soon, Mandavishya was strong again! He ate a frog every day. The frog king was so happy, he didn&rsquo;t notice that there were fewer and fewer frogs!</p>
<p>One day, a big black snake came to the pond. He saw Mandavishya carrying frogs. &ldquo;Why are you carrying them? They&rsquo;re our food!&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mandavishya told him everything.  He said, &ldquo;I love my new easy life! I&rsquo;ve tried all kinds of yummy frogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over time, Mandavishya ate even the other snakes!  He ate the frog king and all his friends.  There were no frogs left!</p>
<p>Remember: Be careful! Not everyone is your friend, even if they seem nice.</p>
