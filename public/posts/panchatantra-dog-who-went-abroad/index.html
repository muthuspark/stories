        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting focusing on Chitranga, a small brown dog with expressive eyes, surrounded by a circle of other similarly colored dogs of similar size and shape.  The scene is dominated by a palette of warm browns, ochres, and muted greens, conveying a sense of home and belonging.   A faint suggestion of a distant house, with a hint of brighter colors depicting food, is barely visible in the background, emphasizing the emotional connection between Chitranga and his fellow dogs over the lure of plentiful food." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-dog-who-went-abroad2.png" width="1024" height="574">

<p>Chitranga the dog lived in a town with no food.  Everyone was hungry, even the animals!</p>
<p>Many dogs were starving and sad. Chitranga was so hungry, he decided to leave and find food in a new place.</p>
<p>After walking a long way, he found a house with its door open!  Inside, there was lots and lots of yummy food. Chitranga ate until his tummy was full!</p>
<p>But then, other dogs saw him. They didn&rsquo;t know him, so they chased him and nipped him with their teeth!  Poor Chitranga!</p>
<p>He ran away and thought, &ldquo;My own town is better, even if it&rsquo;s hungry!&rdquo;  He went back home.</p>
<p>His dog friends asked, &ldquo;Tell us about the new place! Was there lots of food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chitranga said, &ldquo;Yes, there was lots of food!  But the other dogs were mean. It&rsquo;s better to be hungry at home with my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s better to stay with your family and friends, even if things are a little tough!</p>
