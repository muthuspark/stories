        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: Golden hour light filters through the leaves of a massive, ancient oak tree, dappling the grass with warm shadows. A young gardener&rsquo;s daughter, around 8 years old, with rosy cheeks and braided brown hair, beams with a genuine, gap-toothed smile. She points upwards with a dirty, soil-stained finger towards a bird&rsquo;s nest high in the branches. Seven other young girls, ranging in age, giggle and laugh with amusement, their faces flushed with joy. Some wear simple cotton dresses, others patched and worn clothing. A worn, hand-painted watering can rests near the base of the tree. Wildflowers bloom riotously in the foreground, creating a vibrant carpet of color.

<p>In a country were seven daughters of poor parents, who used to come
daily to play under the shady trees in the King&rsquo;s garden with the
gardener&rsquo;s daughter; and daily she used to say to them, &ldquo;When I am
married I shall have a son. Such a beautiful boy as he will be has
never been seen. He will have a moon on his forehead and a star on his
chin.&rdquo; Then her playfellows used to laugh at her and mock her.</p>
<p>But one day the King heard her telling them about the beautiful boy
she would have when she was married, and he said to himself he should
like very much to have such a son; the more so that though he had
already four Queens he had no child. He went, therefore, to the
gardener and told him he wished to marry his daughter. This delighted
the gardener and his wife, who thought it would indeed be grand for
their daughter to become a princess. So they said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the King,
and invited all their friends to the wedding. The King invited all
his, and he gave the gardener as much money as he wanted. Then the
wedding was held with great feasting and rejoicing.</p>

The King, a man in his late 40s with a regal bearing and a neatly trimmed beard, is richly dressed in velvet robes trimmed with gold embroidery. He stands partially hidden behind a marble fountain, overhearing the gardener&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s boast about her future son. He holds a hand to his chin, his brow furrowed in contemplative thought, his gaze fixed on her with a mixture of curiosity and intrigue. Behind him, blurred and partially obscured by the lush foliage, his four bejeweled queens are seen walking leisurely in the distance, their opulent gowns shimmering in the fading light. The mood is secretive and fraught with unspoken tension.

</p>
<p>A year later the day drew near on which the gardener&rsquo;s daughter was to
have her son; and the King&rsquo;s four other Queens came constantly to see
her. One day they said to her, &ldquo;The King hunts every day; and the time
is soon coming when you will have your child. Suppose you fell ill
whilst he was out hunting and could therefore know nothing of your
illness, what would you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the King came home that evening, the gardener&rsquo;s daughter said to
him, &ldquo;Every day you go out hunting. Should I ever be in trouble or
sick while you are away, how could I send for you?&rdquo; The King gave her
a kettle-drum which he placed near the door for her, and he said to
her, &ldquo;Whenever you want me, beat this kettle-drum. No matter how far
away I may be, I shall hear it, and will come at once to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: A dimly lit, lavishly decorated chamber with heavy velvet curtains and a cold, damp stone floor. The gardener&rsquo;s daughter, now a queen, is heavily pregnant, her face pale with anxiety. She sits nervously on a plush velvet cushion, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. The four other queens, their faces etched with sly smirks and veiled malice, stand around her, their opulent gowns casting long shadows. One offers her a kettle drum made of dark, polished wood and stretched animal hide. The air is thick with unspoken threats and jealousy. The light source is a single flickering candle, casting dramatic shadows and highlighting the sinister expressions. Textures are emphasized: the rough texture of the stone floor, the softness of the velvet cushion, and the smooth, polished surface of the kettle drum. A dark, muted color palette enhances the unsettling atmosphere.

</p>
<p>Next morning when the King had gone out to hunt, his four other Queens
came to see the gardener&rsquo;s daughter. She told them all about her
kettle-drum. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do drum on it just to see if the King
really will come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;for why should I call him from his
hunting when I do not want him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind interrupting his hunting,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;Do try if he
really will come to you when you beat your kettle-drum.&rdquo; So at last,
just to please them, she beat it, and the King stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you called me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See, I have left my hunting to
come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want nothing,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I only wished to know if you really
would come to me when I beat my drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the King; &ldquo;but do not call me again unless you
really need me.&rdquo; Then he returned to his hunting.</p>
<p>The next day, when the King had gone out hunting as usual, the four
Queens again came to see the gardener&rsquo;s daughter. They begged and
begged her to beat her drum once more, &ldquo;just to see if the King will
really come to see you this time.&rdquo; At first she refused, but at last
she consented. So she beat her drum, and the King came to her. But
when he found she was neither ill nor in trouble, he was angry, and
said to her, &ldquo;Twice I have left my hunting and lost my game to come to
you when you did not need me. Now you may call me as much as you like,
but I will not come to you,&rdquo; and then he went away in a rage.</p>

Dust kicks up from the horse&rsquo;s hooves as it gallops across a grassy plain. In the distance, the kettle drum is drawn smaller, in front of the imposing silhouette of the castle against a stormy, overcast sky. Lightning flashes intermittently, adding to the drama. Watercolor with bold strokes and dynamic composition, emphasizing movement and urgency." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-boy-who-had-a-moon-on-his-forehead-and-a-star-on-his-chin3.png" width="1024" height="721">

</p>
<p>The third day the gardener&rsquo;s daughter fell ill, and she beat and beat
her kettle-drum; but the King never came. He heard her kettle-drum,
but he thought, &ldquo;She does not really want me; she is only trying to
see if I will go to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the four other Queens came to her, and they said, &ldquo;Here it
is the custom before a child is born to bind its mother&rsquo;s eyes with a
handkerchief that she may not see it just at first. So let us bind
your eyes.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Very well, bind my eyes.&rdquo; The four wives
then tied a handkerchief over them.</p>
<p>Soon after, the gardener&rsquo;s daughter had a beautiful little son, with a
moon on his forehead and a star on his chin, and before the poor
mother had seen him, the four wicked Queens took the boy to the nurse
and said to her, &ldquo;Now you must not let this child make the least sound
for fear his mother should hear him; and in the night you must either
kill him, or else take him away, so that his mother may never see him.
If you obey our orders, we will give you a great many rupees.&rdquo; All
this they did out of spite. The nurse took the little child and put
him into a box, and the four Queens went back to the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter.</p>
<p>First they put a stone into her boy&rsquo;s little bed, and then they took
the handkerchief off her eyes and showed it her, saying, &ldquo;Look! this
is your son!&rdquo; The poor girl cried bitterly, and thought, &ldquo;What will
the King say when he finds no child?&rdquo; But she could do nothing.</p>
<p>When the King came home, he was furious at hearing his youngest wife,
the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, had given him a stone instead of the
beautiful little son she had promised him. He made her one of the
palace servants, and never spoke to her.</p>

The room is sparsely furnished, with a wooden table and a single, overturned chair. The air is heavy with dread and hopelessness.

</p>
<p>In the middle of the night the nurse took the box in which was the
beautiful little prince, and went out to a broad plain in the jungle.
There she dug a hole, made the fastenings of the box sure, and put
the box into the hole, although the child in it was still alive. The
King&rsquo;s dog, whose name was Shankar, had followed her to see what she
did with the box. As soon as she had gone back to the four Queens (who
gave her a great many rupees), the dog went to the hole in which she
had put the box, took the box out, and opened it. When he saw the
beautiful little boy, he was very much delighted and said, &ldquo;If it
pleases Khuda that this child should live, I will not hurt him; I will
not eat him, but I will swallow him whole and hide him in my stomach.&rdquo;
This he did.</p>
<p>After six months had passed, the dog went by night to the jungle, and
thought, &ldquo;I wonder whether the boy is alive or dead.&rdquo; Then he brought
the child out of his stomach and rejoiced over his beauty. The boy was
now six months old. When Shankar had caressed and loved him, he
swallowed him again for another six months. At the end of that time he
went once more by night to the broad jungle-plain. There he brought up
the child out of his stomach (the child was now a year old), and
caressed and petted him a great deal, and was made very happy by his
great beauty.</p>
<p>But this time the dog&rsquo;s keeper had followed and watched the dog; and
he saw all that Shankar did, and the beautiful little child, so he ran
to the four Queens and said to them, &ldquo;Inside the King&rsquo;s dog there is a
child! the loveliest child! He has a moon on his forehead and a star
on his chin. Such a child has never been seen!&rdquo; At this the four wives
were very much frightened, and as soon as the King came home from
hunting they said to him, &ldquo;While you were away your dog came to our
rooms, and tore our clothes and knocked about all our things. We are
afraid he will kill us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Eat your
dinner and be happy. I will have the dog shot to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he ordered his servants to shoot the dog at dawn, but the dog
heard him, and said to himself, &ldquo;What shall I do? The King intends to
kill me. I don&rsquo;t care about that, but what will become of the child if
I am killed? He will die. But I will see if I cannot save him.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>So when it was night, the dog ran to the King&rsquo;s cow, who was called
Suri, and said to her, &ldquo;Suri, I want to give you something, for the
King has ordered me to be shot to-morrow. Will you take great care of
whatever I give you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see what it is,&rdquo; said Suri, &ldquo;I will take care of it if I
can.&rdquo; Then they both went together to the wide plain, and there the
dog brought up the boy. Suri was enchanted with him. &ldquo;I never saw such
a beautiful child in this country,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See, he has a moon on
his forehead and a star on his chin. I will take the greatest care of
him.&rdquo; So saying she swallowed the little prince. The dog made her a
great many salaams, and said, &ldquo;To-morrow I shall die;&rdquo; and the cow
then went back to her stable.</p>
<p>Next morning at dawn the dog was taken to the jungle and shot.</p>
<p>The child now lived in Suri&rsquo;s stomach; and when one whole year had
passed, and he was two years old, the cow went out to the plain, and
said to herself, &ldquo;I do not know whether the child is alive or dead.
But I have never hurt it, so I will see.&rdquo; Then she brought up the boy;
and he played about, and Suri was delighted; she loved him and
caressed him, and talked to him. Then she swallowed him, and returned
to her stable.</p>
<p>At the end of another year she went again to the plain and brought up
the child. He played and ran about for an hour to her great delight,
and she talked to him and caressed him. His great beauty made her very
happy. Then she swallowed him once more and returned to her stable.
The child was now three years old.</p>
<p>But this time the cowherd had followed Suri, and had seen the
wonderful child and all she did to it. So he ran and told the four
Queens, &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s cow has a beautiful boy inside her. He has a moon
on his forehead and a star on his chin. Such a child has never been
seen before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the Queens were terrified. They tore their clothes and their
hair and cried. When the King came home at evening, he asked them why
they were so agitated. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;your cow came and tried to
kill us; but we ran away. She tore our hair and our clothes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never
mind,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Eat your dinner and be happy. The cow shall be
killed to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Now Suri heard the King give this order to the servants, so she said
to herself, &ldquo;What shall I do to save the child?&rdquo; When it was midnight,
she went to the King&rsquo;s horse called Katar, who was very wicked, and
quite untameable. No one had ever been able to ride him; indeed no one
could go near him with safety, he was so savage. Suri said to this
horse, &ldquo;Katar, will you take care of something that I want to give
you, because the King has ordered me to be killed to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Katar; &ldquo;show me what it is.&rdquo; Then Suri brought up the
child, and the horse was delighted with him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will
take the greatest care of him. Till now no one has been able to ride
me, but this child shall ride me.&rdquo; Then he swallowed the boy, and when
he had done so, the cow made him many salaams, saying, &ldquo;It is for this
boy&rsquo;s sake that I am to die.&rdquo; The next morning she was taken to the
jungle and there killed.</p>
<p>The beautiful boy now lived in the horse&rsquo;s stomach, and he stayed in
it for one whole year. At the end of that time the horse thought, &ldquo;I
will see if this child is alive or dead.&rdquo; So he brought him up; and
then he loved him, and petted him, and the little prince played all
about the stable, out of which the horse was never allowed to go.
Katar was very glad to see the child, who was now four years old.
After he had played for some time, the horse swallowed him again. At
the end of another year, when the boy was five years old, Katar
brought him up again, caressed him, loved him, and let him play about
the stable as he had done a year before. Then the horse swallowed him
again.</p>
<p>But this time the groom had seen all that happened, and when it was
morning, and the King had gone away to his hunting, he went to the
four wicked Queens, and told them all he had seen, and all about the
wonderful, beautiful child that lived inside the King&rsquo;s horse Katar.
On hearing the groom&rsquo;s story the four Queens cried, and tore their
hair and clothes, and refused to eat. When the King returned at
evening and asked them why they were so miserable, they said, &ldquo;Your
horse Katar came and tore our clothes, and upset all our things, and
we ran away for fear he should kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Only eat your dinner and be happy. I
will have Katar shot to-morrow.&rdquo; Then he thought that two men unaided
could not kill such a wicked horse, so he ordered his servants to bid
his troop of sepoys shoot him.</p>
<p>So the next day the King placed his sepoys all round the stable, and
he took up his stand with them; and he said he would himself shoot any
one who let his horse escape.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the horse had overheard all these orders. So he brought up
the child and said to him, &ldquo;Go into that little room that leads out of
the stable, and you will find in it a saddle and bridle which you must
put on me. Then you will find in the room some beautiful clothes such
as princes wear; these you must put on yourself; and you must take the
sword and gun you will find there too. Then you must mount on my
back.&rdquo; Now Katar was a fairy-horse, and came from the fairies'
country, so he could get anything he wanted; but neither the King nor
any of his people knew this. When all was ready, Katar burst out of
his stable, with the prince on his back, rushed past the King himself
before the King had time to shoot him, galloped away to the great
jungle-plain, and galloped about all over it. The King saw his horse
had a boy on his back, though he could not see the boy distinctly. The
sepoys tried in vain to shoot the horse; he galloped much too fast;
and at last they were all scattered over the plain. Then the King had
to give it up and go home; and the sepoys went to their homes. The
King could not shoot any of his sepoys for letting his horse escape,
for he himself had let him do so.</p>

</p>
<p>Then Katar galloped away, on, and on, and on; and when night came they
stayed under a tree, he and the King&rsquo;s son. The horse ate grass, and
the boy wild fruits which he found in the jungle. Next morning they
started afresh, and went far, and far, till they came to a jungle in
another country, which did not belong to the little prince&rsquo;s father,
but to another king. Here Katar said to the boy, &ldquo;Now get off my
back.&rdquo; Off jumped the prince. &ldquo;Unsaddle me and take off my bridle;
take off your beautiful clothes and tie them all up in a bundle with
your sword and gun.&rdquo; This the boy did. Then the horse gave him some
poor, common clothes, which he told him to put on. As soon as he was
dressed in them the horse said, &ldquo;Hide your bundle in this grass, and I
will take care of it for you. I will always stay in this jungle-plain,
so that when you want me you will always find me. You must now go away
and find service with some one in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made the boy very sad. &ldquo;I know nothing about anything,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What shall I do all alone in this country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; answered Katar. &ldquo;You will find service, and I will
always stay here to help you when you want me. So go, only before you
go, twist my right ear.&rdquo; The boy did so, and his horse instantly
became a donkey. &ldquo;Now twist your right ear,&rdquo; said Katar. And when the
boy had twisted it, he was no longer a handsome prince, but a poor,
common-looking, ugly man; and his moon and star were hidden.</p>
<p>Then he went away further into the country, until he came to a grain
merchant of the country, who asked him who he was. &ldquo;I am a poor man,&rdquo;
answered the boy, &ldquo;and I want service.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the grain
merchant, &ldquo;you shall be my servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the grain merchant lived near the King&rsquo;s palace, and one night at
twelve o&rsquo;clock the boy was very hot; so he went out into the King&rsquo;s
cool garden, and began to sing a lovely song. The seventh and youngest
daughter of the King heard him, and she wondered who it was who could
sing so deliciously. Then she put on her clothes, rolled up her hair,
and came down to where the seemingly poor common man was lying
singing. &ldquo;Who are you? where do you come from?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>But he answered nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this man who does not answer when I speak to him?&rdquo; thought the
little princess, and she went away. On the second night the same thing
happened, and on the third night too. But on the third night, when she
found she could not make him answer her, she said to him, &ldquo;What a
strange man you are not to answer me when I speak to you.&rdquo; But still
he remained silent, so she went away.</p>
<p>The next day, when he had finished his work, the young prince went to
the jungle to see his horse, who asked him, &ldquo;Are you quite well and
happy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;I am servant to a grain
merchant. The last three nights I have gone into the King&rsquo;s garden and
sung a song, and each night the youngest princess has come to me and
asked me who I am, and whence I came, and I have answered nothing.
What shall I do now?&rdquo; The horse said, &ldquo;Next time she asks you who you
are, tell her you are a very poor man, and came from your own country
to find service here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy then went home to the grain merchant, and at night, when every
one had gone to bed, he went to the King&rsquo;s garden and sang his sweet
song again. The youngest princess heard him, got up, dressed, and came
to him. &ldquo;Who are you? Whence do you come?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a very poor man,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I came from my own country to
seek service here, and I am now one of the grain merchant&rsquo;s servants.&rdquo;
Then she went away. For three more nights the boy sang in the King&rsquo;s
garden, and each night the princess came and asked him the same
questions as before, and the boy gave her the same answers.</p>
<p>Then she went to her father, and said to him, &ldquo;Father, I wish to be
married; but I must choose my husband myself.&rdquo; Her father consented to
this, and he wrote and invited all the Kings and Rajas in the land,
saying, &ldquo;My youngest daughter wishes to be married, but she insists on
choosing her husband herself. As I do not know who it is she wishes to
marry, I beg you will all come on a certain day, for her to see you
and make her choice.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>A great many Kings, Rajas, and their sons accepted this invitation and
came. When they had all arrived, the little princess&rsquo;s father said to
them, &ldquo;To-morrow morning you must all sit together in my garden&rdquo; (the
King&rsquo;s garden was very large), &ldquo;for then my youngest daughter will
come and see you all, and choose her husband. I do not know whom she
will choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngest princess ordered a grand elephant to be ready for her the
next morning, and when the morning came, and all was ready, she
dressed herself in the most lovely clothes, and put on her beautiful
jewels; then she mounted her elephant, which was painted blue. In her
hand she took a gold necklace.</p>
<p>Then she went into the garden where the Kings, Rajas, and their sons
were seated. The boy, the grain merchant&rsquo;s servant, was also in the
garden: not as a suitor, but looking on with the other servants.</p>
<p>The princess rode all round the garden, and looked at all the Kings
and Rajas and princes, and then she hung the gold necklace round the
neck of the boy, the grain merchant&rsquo;s servant. At this everybody
laughed, and the Kings were greatly astonished. But then they and the
Rajas said, &ldquo;What fooling is this?&rdquo; and they pushed the pretended poor
man away, and took the necklace off his neck, and said to him, &ldquo;Get
out of the way, you poor, dirty man. Your clothes are far too dirty
for you to come near us!&rdquo; The boy went far away from them, and stood a
long way off to see what would happen.</p>
<p>Then the King&rsquo;s youngest daughter went all round the garden again,
holding her gold necklace in her hand, and once more she hung it round
the boy&rsquo;s neck. Every one laughed at her and said, &ldquo;How can the King&rsquo;s
daughter think of marrying this poor, common man!&rdquo; and the Kings and
the Rajas, who had come as suitors, all wanted to turn him out of the
garden. But the princess said, &ldquo;Take care! take care! You must not
turn him out. Leave him alone.&rdquo; Then she put him on her elephant, and
took him to the palace.</p>
<p>The Kings and Rajas and their sons were very much astonished, and
said, &ldquo;What does this mean? The princess does not care to marry one of
us, but chooses that very poor man!&rdquo; Her father then stood up, and
said to them all, &ldquo;I promised my daughter she should marry any one she
pleased, and as she has twice chosen that poor, common man, she shall
marry him.&rdquo; And so the princess and the boy were married with great
pomp and splendour: her father and mother were quite content with her
choice; and the Kings, the Rajas and their sons, all returned to their
homes.</p>

</p>
<p>Now the princess&rsquo;s six sisters had all married rich princes, and they
laughed at her for choosing such a poor ugly husband as hers seemed to
be, and said to each other, mockingly, &ldquo;See! our sister has married
this poor, common man!&rdquo; Their six husbands used to go out hunting
every day, and every evening they brought home quantities of all kinds
of game to their wives, and the game was cooked for their dinner and
for the King&rsquo;s; but the husband of the youngest princess always stayed
at home in the palace, and never went out hunting at all. This made
her very sad, and she said to herself, &ldquo;My sisters&rsquo; husbands hunt
every day, but my husband never hunts at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last she said to him, &ldquo;Why do you never go out hunting as my
sisters&rsquo; husbands do every day, and every day they bring home
quantities of all kinds of game? Why do you always stay at home,
instead of doing as they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day he said to her, &ldquo;I am going out to-day to eat the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;go, and take one of the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young prince, &ldquo;I will not ride, I will walk.&rdquo; Then he
went to the jungle-plain where he had left Katar, who all this time
had seemed to be a donkey, and he told Katar everything. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I have married the youngest princess; and when we were married
everybody laughed at her for choosing me, and said, &lsquo;What a very poor,
common man our princess has chosen for her husband!&rsquo; Besides, my wife
is very sad, for her six sisters&rsquo; husbands all hunt every day, and
bring home quantities of game, and their wives therefore are very
proud of them. But I stay at home all day, and never hunt. To-day I
should like to hunt very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Katar, &ldquo;then twist my left ear;&rdquo; and as soon as the boy
had twisted it, Katar was a horse again, and not a donkey any longer.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Katar, &ldquo;twist your left ear, and you will see what a
beautiful young prince you will become.&rdquo; So the boy twisted his own
left ear, and there he stood no longer a poor, common, ugly man, but a
grand young prince with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.
Then he put on his splendid clothes, saddled and bridled Katar, got on
his back with his sword and gun, and rode off to hunt.</p>
<p>He rode very far, and shot a great many birds and a quantity of deer.
That day his six brothers-in-law could find no game, for the beautiful
young prince had shot it all. Nearly all the day long these six
princes wandered about looking in vain for game; till at last they
grew hungry and thirsty, and could find no water, and they had no food
with them. Meanwhile the beautiful young prince had sat down under a
tree, to dine and rest, and there his six brothers-in-law found him.
By his side was some delicious water, and also some roast meat.</p>
<p>When they saw him the six princes said to each other, &ldquo;Look at that
handsome prince. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.
We have never seen such a prince in this jungle before; he must come
from another country.&rdquo; Then they came up to him, and made him many
salaams, and begged him to give them some food and water. &ldquo;Who are
you?&rdquo; said the young prince. &ldquo;We are the husbands of the six elder
daughters of the King of this country,&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;and we have
hunted all day, and are very hungry and thirsty.&rdquo; They did not
recognise their brother-in-law in the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young prince, &ldquo;I will give you something to eat and
drink if you will do as I bid you.&rdquo; &ldquo;We will do all you tell us to
do,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;for if we do not get water to drink, we shall
die.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the young prince. &ldquo;Now you must let me put a
red-hot pice on the back of each of you, and then I will give you food
and water. Do you agree to this?&rdquo; The six princes consented, for they
thought, &ldquo;No one will ever see the mark of the pice, as it will be
covered by our clothes; and we shall die if we have no water to
drink.&rdquo; Then the young prince took six pice, and made them red-hot in
the fire; he laid one on the back of each of the six princes, and gave
them good food and water. They ate and drank; and when they had
finished they made him many salaams and went home.</p>
<p>The young prince stayed under the tree till it was evening; then he
mounted his horse and rode off to the King&rsquo;s palace. All the people
looked at him as he came riding along, saying, &ldquo;What a splendid young
prince that is! He has a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin.&rdquo;
But no one recognised him. When he came near the King&rsquo;s palace, all
the King&rsquo;s servants asked him who he was; and as none of them knew
him, the gate-keepers would not let him pass in. They all wondered who
he could be, and all thought him the most beautiful prince that had
ever been seen.</p>
<p>At last they asked him who he was. &ldquo;I am the husband of your youngest
princess,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, indeed you are not,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;for he is a poor,
common-looking, and ugly man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am he,&rdquo; answered the prince; only no one would believe him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us the truth,&rdquo; said the servants; &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you cannot recognise me,&rdquo; said the young prince, &ldquo;but call
the youngest princess here. I wish to speak to her.&rdquo; The servants
called her, and she came. &ldquo;That man is not my husband,&rdquo; she said at
once. &ldquo;My husband is not nearly as handsome as that man. This must be
a prince from another country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she said to him, &ldquo;Who are you? Why do you say you are my
husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am your husband. I am telling you the truth,&rdquo; answered the
young prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you are not, you are not telling me the truth,&rdquo; said the little
princess. &ldquo;My husband is not a handsome man like you. I married a very
poor, common-looking man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but nevertheless I am your husband. I
was the grain merchant&rsquo;s servant; and one hot night I went into your
father&rsquo;s garden and sang, and you heard me, and came and asked me who
I was and where I came from, and I would not answer you. And the same
thing happened the next night, and the next, and on the fourth I told
you I was a very poor man, and had come from my country to seek
service in yours, and that I was the grain merchant&rsquo;s servant. Then
you told your father you wished to marry, but must choose your own
husband; and when all the Kings and Rajas were seated in your father&rsquo;s
garden, you sat on an elephant and went round and looked at them all;
and then twice hung your gold necklace round my neck, and chose me.
See, here is your necklace, and here are the ring and the handkerchief
you gave me on our wedding day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she believed him, and was very glad that her husband was such a
beautiful young prince. &ldquo;What a strange man you are!&rdquo; she said to
him. &ldquo;Till now you have been poor, and ugly, and common-looking. Now
you are beautiful and look like a prince; I never saw such a handsome
man as you are before; and yet I know you must be my husband.&rdquo; Then
she worshipped God and thanked him for letting her have such a
husband. &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a beautiful husband. There is no one
like him in this country. He has a moon on his forehead and a star on
his chin.&rdquo; Then she took him into the palace, and showed him to her
father and mother and to every one. They all said they had never seen
any one like him, and were all very happy. And the young prince lived
as before in the King&rsquo;s palace with his wife, and Katar lived in the
King&rsquo;s stables.</p>
<p>One day, when the King and his seven sons-in-law were in his
court-house, and it was full of people, the young prince said to him,
&ldquo;There are six thieves here in your court-house.&rdquo; &ldquo;Six thieves!&rdquo; said
the King. &ldquo;Where are they? Show them to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;There they are,&rdquo; said
the young prince, pointing to his six brothers-in-law. The King and
every one else in the court-house were very much astonished, and would
not believe the young prince. &ldquo;Take off their coats,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
then you will see for yourselves that each of them has the mark of a
thief on his back.&rdquo; So their coats were taken off the six princes, and
the King and everybody in the court-house saw the mark of the red-hot
pice. The six princes were very much ashamed, but the young prince was
very glad. He had not forgotten how his brothers-in-law had laughed at
him and mocked him when he seemed a poor, common man.</p>
<p>Now, when Katar was still in the jungle, before the prince was
married, he had told the boy the whole story of his birth, and all
that had happened to him and his mother. &ldquo;When you are married,&rdquo; he
said to him, &ldquo;I will take you back to your father&rsquo;s country.&rdquo; So two
months after the young prince had revenged himself on his
brothers-in-law, Katar said to him, &ldquo;It is time for you to return to
your father. Get the King to let you go to your own country, and I
will tell you what to do when we get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince always did what his horse told him to do; so he went to his
wife and said to her, &ldquo;I wish very much to go to my own country to see
my father and mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;I will tell my
father and mother, and ask them to let us go.&rdquo; Then she went to them,
and told them, and they consented to let her and her husband leave
them. The King gave his daughter and the young prince a great many
horses, and elephants, and all sorts of presents, and also a great
many sepoys to guard them. In this grand state they travelled to the
prince&rsquo;s country, which was not a great many miles off. When they
reached it they pitched their tents on the same plain in which the
prince had been left in his box by the nurse, where Shankar and Suri
had swallowed him so often.</p>
<p>When the King, his father, the gardener&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s husband, saw the
prince&rsquo;s camp, he was very much alarmed, and thought a great King had
come to make war on him. He sent one of his servants, therefore, to
ask whose camp it was. The young prince then wrote him a letter, in
which he said, &ldquo;You are a great King. Do not fear me. I am not come to
make war on you. I am as if I were your son. I am a prince who has
come to see your country and to speak with you. I wish to give you a
grand feast, to which every one in your country must come&ndash;men and
women, old and young, rich and poor, of all castes; all the children,
fakirs, and sepoys. You must bring them all here to me for a week, and
I will feast them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was delighted with this letter, and ordered all the men,
women, and children of all castes, fakirs, and sepoys, in his country
to go to the prince&rsquo;s camp to a grand feast the prince would give
them. So they all came, and the King brought his four wives too. All
came, at least all but the gardener&rsquo;s daughter. No one had told her to
go to the feast, for no one had thought of her.</p>
<p>When all the people were assembled, the prince saw his mother was not
there, and he asked the King, &ldquo;Has every one in your country come to
my feast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, every one,&rdquo; said the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; asked the prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; answered the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure one woman has not come,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;She is your
gardener&rsquo;s daughter, who was once your wife and is now a servant in
your palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;I had forgotten her.&rdquo; Then the prince told his
servants to take his finest palanquin and to fetch the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter. They were to bathe her, dress her in beautiful clothes and
handsome jewels, and then bring her to him in the palanquin.</p>
<p>While the servants were bringing the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, the King
thought how handsome the young prince was; and he noticed particularly
the moon on his forehead and the star on his chin, and he wondered in
what country the young prince was born.</p>
<p>And now the palanquin arrived bringing the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, and
the young prince went himself and took her out of it, and brought her
into the tent. He made her a great many salaams. The four wicked wives
looked on and were very much surprised and very angry. They remembered
that, when they arrived, the prince had made them no salaams, and
since then had not taken the least notice of them; whereas he could
not do enough for the gardener&rsquo;s daughter, and seemed very glad to see
her.</p>
<p>When they were all at dinner, the prince again made the gardener&rsquo;s
daughter a great many salaams, and gave her food from all the nicest
dishes. She wondered at his kindness to her, and thought, &ldquo;Who is this
handsome prince, with a moon on his forehead and a star on his chin? I
never saw any one so beautiful. What country does he come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three days were thus passed in feasting, and all that time the
King and his people were talking about the prince&rsquo;s beauty, and
wondering who he was.</p>
<p>One day the prince asked the King if he had any children. &ldquo;None,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who I am?&rdquo; asked the prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Tell me who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your son,&rdquo; answered the prince, &ldquo;and the gardener&rsquo;s daughter is
my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King shook his head sadly. &ldquo;How can you be my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when
I have never had any children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am your son,&rdquo; answered the prince. &ldquo;Your four wicked Queens
told you the gardener&rsquo;s daughter had given you a stone and not a son;
but it was they who put the stone in my little bed, and then they
tried to kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King did not believe him. &ldquo;I wish you were my son,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
as I never had a child, you cannot be my son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you remember your
dog Shankar, and how you had him killed? And do you remember your cow
Suri, and how you had her killed too? Your wives made you kill them
because of me. And,&rdquo; he said, taking the King to Katar, &ldquo;do you know
whose horse that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King looked at Katar, and then said, &ldquo;That is my horse Katar.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Do you not remember how he rushed past you
out of his stable with me on his back?&rdquo; Then Katar told the King the
prince was really his son, and told him all the story of his birth,
and of his life up to that moment; and when the King found the
beautiful prince was indeed his son, he was so glad, so glad. He put
his arms round him and kissed him and cried for joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;you must come with me to my palace, and live
with me always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;that I cannot do. I cannot go to your palace.
I only came here to fetch my mother; and now that I have found her, I
will take her with me to my father-in-law&rsquo;s palace. I have married a
King&rsquo;s daughter, and we live with her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now that I have found you, I cannot let you go,&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;You and your wife must come and live with your mother and me in my
palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we will never do,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;unless you will kill your
four wicked Queens with your own hand. If you will do that, we will
come and live with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the King killed his Queens, and then he and his wife, the
gardener&rsquo;s daughter, and the prince and his wife, all went to live in
the King&rsquo;s palace, and lived there happily together for ever after;
and the King thanked God for giving him such a beautiful son, and for
ridding him of his four wicked wives.</p>
<p>Katar did not return to the fairies&rsquo; country, but stayed always with
the young prince, and never left him.</p>
