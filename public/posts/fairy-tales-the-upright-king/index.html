    <p>Once upon a time, there was a super-rich king named Harchand Raja, and he had a son named Manikchand. He had tons of money and a big, beautiful garden with amazing flowers and yummy fruits! He loved his garden so much. Every morning, before he took a bath, he gave a poor beggar a whole bunch of gold coins.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 714;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of King Harchand Raja, in ornate crimson and gold robes with intricate embroidery and pearl accents, giving a handful of gleaming gold coins to a humble, grateful beggar. The beggar is clad in tattered brown cloth, his face etched with lines of hardship but softened by genuine appreciation. The background features a vibrant, lush garden filled with colorful flowers like hibiscus and marigolds, and fruit trees laden with mangoes and pomegranates, all bathed in warm, soft morning light casting long, gentle shadows. Dewdrops cling to the petals, reflecting the light. The atmosphere is peaceful and benevolent. The artistic style is consistent watercolor with soft blending and natural flow, emphasizing the textures of the cloth and the smoothness of the gold." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-upright-king0.png" width="1024" height="714">

</p>
<p>Harchand Raja prayed to God a lot, and God really liked him. One day, God said, &ldquo;I want to see if Harchand Raja really loves me. I&rsquo;m going to make him poor for twelve years!&rdquo; That night, God turned into a giant pig and gobbled up everything in Harchand Raja&rsquo;s garden!</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 736;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a giant, gluttonous pig, rendered in shades of earthy browns, dusty pinks, and muddy greys, greedily devouring the king&rsquo;s garden. Its coarse bristles are visible, and mud clings to its hooves. The garden is depicted as partially destroyed, with uprooted plants, scattered fruit (some half-eaten), and broken terracotta pots. The pig&rsquo;s small, beady eyes should gleam with mischievous and destructive intent, reflecting the early afternoon sun. Saliva drips from its mouth. The lighting is harsh, with sharp contrasts between light and shadow, conveying a sense of chaos and destruction. The texture of the churned earth and ripped leaves is emphasized. The watercolor style is loose and expressive, capturing the dynamism of the pig&rsquo;s rampage." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-upright-king1.png" width="1024" height="736">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>Then, the pig ran away into the forest. The next morning, the gardener woke up and looked at the garden. He couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes! It was all ruined. There was nothing left! He ran to the king and cried, &ldquo;Oh, King! Your garden is totally wrecked! Last night, a pig ate everything!&rdquo; The king didn&rsquo;t believe him. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; said the gardener. &ldquo;Come see for yourself!&rdquo; So, the king got dressed and went to the garden. It was empty! He went back to the house feeling very sad. He still gave the beggar his gold coins that morning. After breakfast, he went hunting. The pig, who had run into the woods, changed into a very old beggar. He was shaking all over! As Harchand Raja walked by, the old beggar held out his hand and said, &ldquo;Please give me some coins. I&rsquo;m so hungry!&rdquo; The king said, &ldquo;Come to my palace, and I&rsquo;ll give you lots of gold coins!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the beggar. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t give me that much!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Every morning, before I bathe, I give a beggar lots of gold coins!&rdquo; &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the beggar. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give away your money like that!&rdquo; &ldquo;Really, I do!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I promise to give you lots of gold coins!&rdquo; So, the beggar followed Harchand Raja home. When they got to the palace, the king told his helper to give the old beggar his gold coins. The helper went to get the gold, but all the king&rsquo;s gold, silver, and jewels had turned into charcoal! The helper ran back to the king and said, &ldquo;Oh, King! All your gold and silver and jewels are charcoal!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Come see, King!&rdquo; said the helper, who was really scared. The king went to see for himself and was very sad when he saw all the charcoal.</p>

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 721;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of King Harchand Raja, now dressed in simple, worn clothing of faded indigo and grey, patched and mended, looking dejected as he surveys the smoldering charcoal where his gold and jewels once were. His face is etched with sadness and lines of weariness, but his jawline is firm with resolve. His hands are calloused and clasped tightly together. The palace is visible in the background, appearing grand yet distant and untouchable, framed by a hazy, smoky sky. Dust motes hang in the air, illuminated by the weak, setting sun. The emotional tone is somber and melancholic. The watercolor style focuses on conveying texture - the roughness of his clothing, the gritty texture of the charcoal, and the smooth, cold stone of the palace walls." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-upright-king2.png" width="1024" height="721">

</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;God has made me very poor, but I still have to give the beggar the money I promised.&rdquo; So, he went to the beggar and said, &ldquo;All my gold, silver, and jewels have turned into charcoal. I will sell my wife, my son, and myself, and then I&rsquo;ll give you the money I promised!&rdquo; He got his wife and son, and they left the palace, their houses, servants, and everything they owned. He went to a seller and sold his queen. She was called Hirali, and she was very beautiful. The seller gave the king some gold coins for the queen. Then, Harchand Raja sold his son Manikchand to a cow herder. The cow herder gave him some gold coins for the boy. Then, he sold himself to a man who took care of a pond. He threw dead bodies into the pond. The man paid him some gold coins, and he gave the coins to the beggar, who went home. The pond man said, &ldquo;Will you stay by the pond while I go home and weave baskets? If someone brings you a dead body, throw it in the water. If it&rsquo;s a grown-up, take one coin. If it&rsquo;s a child, take a few coins. If they don&rsquo;t have any money, take a piece of cloth. Don&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo; Then, the pond man left Harchand by the pond. Harchand Raja stayed by the pond for many days. When people brought dead bodies, he threw them in. He took money or cloth, just like the pond man told him to. One day, Manikchand, the king&rsquo;s son, died. Hirali Rani went to the cow herder to ask for her dead son. The cow herder gave him to her, and she took him to the pond. Harchand Raja was sitting by the pond, and when Hirali saw him, she said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my husband! He won&rsquo;t take any money for throwing his own child into the water!&rdquo; So, she went up to him and said, &ldquo;Will you throw this child into the pond for me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said Harchand Raja. &ldquo;But first, give me some coins.&rdquo; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take any money for throwing your own son into the pond, will you?&rdquo; said the queen. &ldquo;I have to take payment,&rdquo; said Harchand Raja, &ldquo;because I have to do what the pond man says. If you don&rsquo;t have money, give me a piece of cloth.&rdquo; So, the queen tore off a big piece of her scarf and gave it to him. The king took his son and threw him into the pond.</p>

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 794; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of King Harchand Raja reluctantly throwing the limp body of a young boy (Manikchand) into a murky pond, the water reflecting a distorted image of his tormented face. Queen Hirali stands nearby, veiled in deep purple, her shoulders shaking as she weeps, offering a torn piece of her faded silk scarf, edged with gold thread, as payment. The pond is surrounded by somber, weeping willow trees with trailing branches, casting long, eerie shadows. The atmosphere is heavy with profound grief and a sense of irreversible loss. The lighting is dim and overcast, with the only light source being a sliver of moon partially obscured by clouds. The texture of the water, the rough bark of the trees, and the delicate fabric of the scarf are meticulously rendered. The expressions are crucial: the king&rsquo;s anguish, the queen&rsquo;s despair, and the boy&rsquo;s lifeless stillness." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-upright-king3.png" width="794" height="1024">

<p>As he threw him in, he shouted to the king of the fish, who was a big alligator, &ldquo;Take care of this body!&rdquo; The king of the fish said, &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; Then, the queen went back to the seller. The king caught a fish, cooked it, and put it by the pond. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go bathe and then eat it.&rdquo; So, he took off his clothes and went into the pond to bathe. When he came out, he put on clean clothes. As he picked up his fish to eat it, it wiggled and jumped back into the water alive!</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 722; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of King Harchand Raja, looking surprised and joyful, his face breaking into a wide, genuine smile, as the cooked fish (still on a simple wooden plate) he was about to eat leaps back into the pond alive. Sunlight glints off the water, creating shimmering highlights and symbolizing renewed hope. His simple, worn clothes and surroundings – a simple mud hut with a thatched roof – contrast sharply with the vibrant, revitalized fish, now shimmering with silver and gold scales. The pond&rsquo;s surface ripples with life. The air feels lighter and fresher. The watercolor style is bright and optimistic, using vibrant colors to emphasize the miraculous event and the king&rsquo;s renewed spirit. Details include the steam rising from the cooked fish, the texture of the wooden plate, and the details of the woven roof." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-upright-king4.png" width="722" height="1024">

</p>
<p>The king sat down by the pond again, feeling very sad. He said, &ldquo;For twelve years, it&rsquo;s been hard to find food. How long will God keep me hungry?&rdquo; God was happy that Harchand was so patient and never complained. Some days later, God came down to earth as a man with an angel.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 751;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of God, depicted as a kind-faced man with flowing white robes and a gentle, radiant aura, standing beside an angel with shimmering wings near a serene pond. The angel&rsquo;s wings are adorned with feathers that seem to glow from within. King Harchand Raja sits nearby on a moss-covered rock, looking weary but hopeful, his eyes fixed on the divine figures. God is gesturing towards the king with a compassionate expression, his hand outstretched in a gesture of comfort and forgiveness. The pond reflects a peaceful sky with fluffy white clouds. The air is filled with a soft, ethereal glow. The watercolor style is delicate and ethereal, emphasizing the divine presence and the atmosphere of peace and redemption. Light appears to emanate from God and the angel, creating a sense of holiness." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-upright-king5.png" width="1024" height="751">

</p>
<p>The angel said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;s sitting by the pond.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said God. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired.&rdquo; &ldquo;Please?&rdquo; said the angel. &ldquo;I really want to go!&rdquo; God said, &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; So, they walked to where Harchand Raja was sitting. God said to him, &ldquo;Would you like to have your wife, your son, and your kingdom back?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I would!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;But how can I get them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me the truth,&rdquo; said God. &ldquo;Do you really want your kingdom back?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; said the king. Then, Manikchand&rsquo;s body, which had been floating on the water, rose up out of the water, and Manikchand was alive again! The father and son hugged each other. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to the pond man.&rdquo; Harchand Raja agreed, and they asked the pond man how much he wanted for Harchand Raja. The pond man said, &ldquo;I gave some gold coins for him. I want a little more.&rdquo; So, they paid the pond man. Then, they went to the seller and said, &ldquo;How much do you want for Hirali Rani?&rdquo; The seller said, &ldquo;I gave some gold coins for her. I want a little more!&rdquo; So, they paid the seller, took Hirali Rani, and went to the cow herder. &ldquo;How much do you want for Manikchand?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;I gave some gold coins for him,&rdquo; said the cow herder. &ldquo;I want a little more!&rdquo; So, they paid the cow herder. Harchand Raja went home to his palace with Hirali Rani and Manikchand. He thanked the man for helping them. When they got to the palace, the garden was beautiful! The charcoal had turned back into gold, silver, and jewels. The servants were waiting for them. They went into the palace and lived happily ever after!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of King Harchand Raja, Queen Hirali, and Manikchand embracing in their restored garden. King Harchand Raja is wearing newly made, simpler robes, Queen Hirali is adorned in a silk sari of vibrant colors, and Manikchand is healthy and radiant. The garden is once again lush and vibrant, filled with blooming flowers, gold, silver, and sparkling jewels scattered amongst the foliage, glittering in the afternoon sun. Servants are visible in the background, smiling and welcoming them home, their faces etched with relief and happiness. The palace stands majestically in the background, radiating warmth and prosperity, windows aglow with golden light. Butterflies flutter around the flowers. The watercolor style is joyous and celebratory, using bright, saturated colors to capture the atmosphere of happiness and restoration. Emphasis is placed on the details of the jewels, the silk clothing, and the lush vegetation, creating a scene of abundance and harmony." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-upright-king6.png" width="1024" height="722">
