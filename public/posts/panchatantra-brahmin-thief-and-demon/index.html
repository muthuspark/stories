<p>Once upon a time, in a small town, lived a kind Brahmin named Drona. Drona was very simple. He didn&rsquo;t wear fancy clothes or use perfumes. He prayed very hard, every day, even when it was hot, cold, or rainy!  Because of this, he was a little thin and his hair and nails were long.</p>
<p>One day, someone gave Drona two baby cows. He loved them and took good care of them, feeding them lots of yummy food.  Soon, they were big and strong!</p>
<p>A sneaky thief saw the cows and wanted to steal them.  He planned to take them at night.</p>
<p>On his way, the thief met a scary demon!  The thief was very frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a demon,&rdquo; the demon boomed. &ldquo;I always tell the truth, and I hate liars. Tell me who you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief told the truth. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a thief, and I&rsquo;m going to steal those cows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the thief and the demon became friends because they were both honest. They made a plan: the demon would eat Drona, and the thief would steal the cows. They went to Drona&rsquo;s house together.</p>
<p>They hid and waited for Drona to fall asleep.  The demon wanted to eat Drona first, but the thief wanted to steal the cows first. They argued loudly!</p>
<p>Their arguing woke Drona up! The thief told Drona about the demon, and the demon told Drona about the thief.</p>
<p>Drona started to pray. The scary demon ran away! Then Drona chased the thief away with a stick.</p>
<p>The wise say: When bad people fight, good people win!</p>
