<p>Once upon a time, in a small village, lived ten cloth sellers who were best friends and always traveled together. One day, they went on a long trip to sell their beautiful fabrics and earned lots of money! As they headed back home, they had to pass through a thick, spooky forest. They didn&rsquo;t know it, but three sneaky robbers lived in that forest!</p> </p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration of seven princesses in a grand, dimly lit kitchen at dusk. Balna, slightly separated and looking skeptical, observes a gaunt, elderly woman (Prudhan&rsquo;s widow) with deeply etched wrinkles taking firewood from a cast-iron stove. Soft light streams through a high arched window, casting long shadows. Dust motes dance in the light. Dirt subtly scatters from the widow&rsquo;s gnarled hands, falling towards a simmering pot of stew. The wooden floor is worn and uneven. The color palette is muted, with earthy tones and hints of faded gold. Balna&rsquo;s expression is a mix of suspicion and compassion, her body language guarded. The other princesses, dressed in colorful, slightly faded silk gowns, are focused on the widow with varying degrees of concern. Watercolor style: soft blending, natural flow, subtle washes." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-punchkin0.png" width="721" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration of Queen Lona, dressed in royal blue velvet robes trimmed with intricate gold embroidery, sitting sadly on a jade-inlaid divan in her opulent palace. Sunlight, a warm golden hue, streams through a large, arched window with delicate Mughal-inspired latticework, casting intricate shadows across the polished marble floor. Her gaze is downcast towards her lap, where her hands are clasped tightly, her knuckles white. A single, shimmering tear rolls down her cheek, catching the light. The palace architecture features intricate Mughal-inspired designs: ornate columns, jewel-toned mosaics, and tapestries depicting scenes of past glory. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and golds, creating a somber yet majestic atmosphere. Soft blending emphasizes the melancholic mood. Texture is subtly applied to the velvet robes and marble flooring." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-raja-rasalu0.png" width="716" height="1024">

She&rsquo;s walking down a dirt path, her two buckets of milk are shown partially tipped over, spilling white milk onto the path and her feet.  Revati&rsquo;s face shows a mix of shock and sadness, tears in her eyes. In the background, use soft, muted greens and browns to depict a small village with simple houses.  Maintain a consistent style and color palette throughout the image, emphasizing the watercolor texture.
