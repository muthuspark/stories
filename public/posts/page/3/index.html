        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical forest scene. Two small, bright green frogs, identical in size and shape, are in a deep, dark pit. One frog has a defeated expression and is lying down, while the other frog is mid-jump, eyes determined and mouth open in a silent cheer.  The pit is rendered with deep blues and purples, contrasting sharply with the lush greens of the surrounding forest. Above the pit, a group of larger, paler green frogs are clustered, some with worried expressions, their bodies slightly silhouetted. The overall style is delicate and slightly cartoonish, maintaining consistent frog size, shape, and color throughout the painting." src="/posts/images/image_the-two-frogs00.png" width="1024" height="535">

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>A long time ago, there was a wicked cat who always bothered lots of mice.  The mice decided they needed to solve this problem. So, they all gathered to discuss their biggest problem: this wicked cat who chased them and ate them!  &ldquo;This is chaos!&rdquo; squeaked one mouse angrily.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a lively mice council meeting.  A group of small, brown mice with large, expressive eyes are gathered in a circle, their fur rendered with delicate watercolor washes. One older, slightly larger mouse with grey fur is speaking, his paw raised. In the background, a shadowy, sleek black cat with piercing green eyes is subtly depicted, lurking just out of reach.  The overall palette is warm and earthy, with splashes of brighter color indicating the mice&rsquo;s excitement and worry. The scene is set in a cozy mouse hole, with textures suggested through loose watercolor application. Focus on conveying the mice&rsquo;s anxious energy and the cat&rsquo;s ominous presence. Style: whimsical, slightly naive watercolor." src="/posts/images/image_the-wicked-cat-and-the-mice0.png" width="1024" height="537">

<p>The guard wondered who this sadhu was and why he claimed to be the king&rsquo;s brother.  He thought maybe it was a distant relative who had become a sadhu.  The guard told the king, who smiled and said, &ldquo;Let the sadhu in.&rdquo;</p> </p>

<p>In the jungle of Ajanar, lived two strong lions, Shursingh and Singraj. Shursingh was getting old and couldn&rsquo;t hunt anymore.</p>
<p>Singraj would hunt for him and bring him food.  When Singraj went hunting, Shursingh was all alone.  The other animals were too scared to go near him.</p>
<p>One day, a pack of jackals saw Shursingh alone.  They thought they found a big meal! They surrounded him and bit him, hurting him badly. Shursingh fainted.</p> </p>
