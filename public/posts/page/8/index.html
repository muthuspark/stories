<p>Once upon a time, there was a King called the Pomegranate King, and a Queen called the Pomegranate Flower. The Queen passed away, leaving behind two little children: a girl about four or five years old, and a boy who was three. The King was very sad when she died because he loved her very much. He loved his two children a lot too! He got them two helpers: a cook to make their food, and a nanny to look after them. He also made sure they learned to read and write. Soon after his wife&rsquo;s passing, the daughter of another King lost her husband. She said she would marry another King if he wanted to marry her, and she really wanted to marry the Pomegranate King! So, her father went to visit the Pomegranate King and told him that his daughter wanted to marry him. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get married again. If I do, the woman I marry might not be nice to my two children. She won&rsquo;t take good care of them. She won&rsquo;t hug them and make them feel better when they&rsquo;re sad.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, but my daughter will be very good to them, I promise you,&rdquo; said the other King. &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said the Pomegranate King, &ldquo;I will marry her.&rdquo; And so, they got married.</p> </p>

<p>To get to the market, they had to cross a river. One day, the donkey fell into the river!  Splash! The salt bags fell in too. The salt dissolved in the water, making the bags much lighter.</p> </p>

The King, seated on a gold-leaf throne, is surrounded by seven beautiful Queens, all looking melancholic. Soft, dappled sunlight streams through stained-glass windows, casting long shadows on the polished marble floor. The man&rsquo;s beard has individual strands visible, and his clothes are slightly worn, adding to his humbleness. The King&rsquo;s crown glints, but his face is etched with worry lines. The Queens are dressed in rich velvet gowns in muted jewel tones, their faces pale and tear-streaked. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, but subtly tinged with sadness. Texture: The throne&rsquo;s velvet cushion is slightly worn, and the marble floor reflects the light unevenly.
