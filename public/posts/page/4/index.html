        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting in a whimsical style depicting a hungry, light brown dog with oversized, expressive eyes. The dog is depicted three times: 1) sniffing out a glistening, large bone in a field of bright, loose watercolor washes of green and yellow, 2) facing a river with a clear reflection of itself holding the same bone, 3) sadly sitting by a now cloudy, dark-blueish river, the bone lost.  The dog should be consistently drawn, with the same size and color throughout, emphasizing its emotions through its eyes and body language. Use soft, translucent watercolor techniques to create a dreamy, slightly melancholic mood." src="/posts/images/image_the-greedy-dog2.png" width="1024" height="622">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a lion, consistently colored burnt orange and ochre with a large, slightly grumpy mane, and a small, brown rabbit with long ears.  The background is a lush, vibrant green jungle scene painted in loose watercolor style.  The lion is depicted twice: once large and menacing, approaching a small, slightly blurry deer in the mid-ground; the second, smaller and dejected, looking sadly at an empty space where the rabbit once sat.  The deer should be a soft, muted brown. Use a limited palette of greens, browns, and oranges. Focus on capturing the contrast in the lion&rsquo;s demeanor between the two scenes, highlighting his hunger and regret." src="/posts/images/image_the-greedy-lion0.png" width="1024" height="681">

In the background, a whimsical fairy with shimmering teal hair and gown, is partially obscured behind a gnarled, golden tree, her expression a mix of sadness and pity. The overall color palette is warm, with golds and browns contrasting against the cool teal of the fairy and the pink of the girl&rsquo;s dress. Focus on the emotional contrast between the man&rsquo;s greedy expression and the girl’s innocent, now golden, form.
