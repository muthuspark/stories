The other side overhangs a busy road with vintage, brightly colored cars – a turquoise Ambassador, a sunshine yellow Fiat – a sputtering, exhaust-filled bus, and a slow-moving horse-drawn cart piled high with goods. People walking by clutch their hats against a sudden gust of wind, their expressions a mixture of surprise and amusement. Dust motes dance in the sunlight filtering through the leaves.

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>As Romi was about to hop on his bike, he saw smoke way off in the distance, behind the trees.</p>
<p>‘Looks like a forest fire!’ said Prem, his friend from school.</p>
<p>‘It&rsquo;s far to the side,’ Romi said. ‘Nowhere near the road.’</p>
<p>‘The wind is super strong,’ Prem said, watching dry leaves swirl around the road.</p>
<p>It was the middle of May, and it hadn&rsquo;t rained in the area for weeks. The grass was brown, and the leaves on the trees were dusty. Even though it was almost six in the evening, the boys&rsquo; shirts were sweaty.</p> </p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a kind Brahmin and his wife, Shandili, in warm earth tones. Shandili, in a reddish-brown sari, is tending to a small pile of sesame seeds near a sun-drenched house with a terracotta roof. A mischievous-looking dog with dark brown fur is nearby, its tail wagging, near scattered sesame seeds.  The Brahmin, in a similar shade of brown but a slightly lighter dhoti, is depicted walking away from the house towards a distant city visible on the horizon, small and hazy, suggesting his journey to procure food. The overall style should be reminiscent of traditional Indian miniature painting with a soft, watercolor wash." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-shandili-and-sesame-seeds0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Grandpa, a kind-faced, elderly man with deeply etched wrinkles around his warm, hazel eyes, a neatly trimmed white mustache, and wearing traditional Indian clothing (perhaps a dhoti and kurta in earthy tones), walking down a bustling Dehra market street in the golden afternoon light. A small, emerald-green python with intricate scale patterns is draped around his neck, catching the light. The boy, his grandson, walks beside him, looking proud with a gap-toothed grin and wearing a simple cotton shirt and shorts. Long shadows stretch across the dusty street. Market stalls overflow with colorful produce – bright red chilies, vibrant mangoes, and glistening green vegetables. People in traditional attire bustle around, some carrying woven baskets. Soft watercolor washes create a sense of heat and atmosphere. The overall tone is heartwarming and slightly surreal." src="/posts/images/image_ruskin-snake-trouble0.png" width="1024" height="638">

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>Once upon a time, there was a king named King Hamansa. He had a son named Prince Gursan, who married Princess Khelapari, the daughter of King Gulabsa. After the wedding, Prince Gursan took her home to his father&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>One day, Prince Gursan came home from hunting. He was super tired and really thirsty! It was around lunchtime. He asked Princess Khelapari to get him some water, and while she went to get it, he fell fast asleep. When she came back, he was still sleeping! He slept all afternoon and all night because he was so tired, and didn&rsquo;t wake up until the next morning. His wife stood by him the whole time, holding the water in a shiny cup. When he woke up and saw that she had been standing there all that time, he felt really bad. He asked for forgiveness and wished that his wife could have anything she wanted, no matter what it was! So, Princess Khelapari wished that she would know everything that happened in the world, even in faraway places, all by herself without anyone telling her.</p> </p>

A large, grumpy-looking brown monkey with soaking wet fur is huddled beneath the tree, looking up at the nest. The rain is suggested by dark, blurred washes of blue and grey around the monkey and tree.
