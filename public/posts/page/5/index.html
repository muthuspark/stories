He gazes up at the pot with wide, greedy eyes that reflect the moonlight, a faint, almost manic smile playing on his thin lips.

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had five buffaloes and a cow. He took very good care of them. He would bring them fresh, green grass from far away and feed them. The buffaloes and the cow were happy with the farmer&rsquo;s care.</p>

Lush green grass surrounds them.  In the background, a small village is visible, painted in muted earth tones.  The style should be reminiscent of children&rsquo;s book illustration, with soft outlines and gentle color blending.  A small, mischievous orange cat is subtly lurking near a pail of overflowing milk in the foreground." src="/posts/images/image_the-farmer-and-the-cat00.png" width="1024" height="720">

A weary farmer with ragged, patched clothes stained with earth stands in front of the ornate, sun-drenched house of a plump and richly dressed money lender. The money lender&rsquo;s house boasts intricately carved wooden doors and vibrant, blooming jasmine climbing its walls. The farmer, face etched with worry and sweat glistening on his brow, gestures with open, trembling hands in desperation. Long shadows stretch from the farmer and the house. The color palette is warm, with oranges and yellows dominating, but a somber gray clinging to the farmer. Texture: rough, woven mat outside the money lender&rsquo;s door, contrasting with the smoothness of the farmer&rsquo;s calloused hands." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-farmer-and-the-money-lender0.png" width="1024" height="680">

Birbal, slightly smaller but with a distinct, wise expression, stands beside him in calming blues and greens.  A worried merchant, depicted in muted browns and greys, kneels before them, recounting his plight.  In the foreground, a line of servants, each holding a similar-sized wooden stick,  are depicted in various muted earth tones with one servant clearly smaller and noticeably fidgeting, highlighted with a darker shadow suggesting guilt.

He wears simple, patched brown homespun clothing. He&rsquo;s napping fitfully under the sprawling, gnarled branches of a colossal banyan tree in a golden wheat field, the wheat swaying gently in the breeze. The late afternoon sun casts long, dappled shadows across the field. A large, imposing cobra with scales that shimmer with subtle iridescence and a proudly raised hood is emerging from a small, crumbling earthen mound near the tree roots. The mound is covered in dry, cracked earth and scattered pebbles. The air is thick with the scent of dry grass and warm earth.
