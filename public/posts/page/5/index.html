The rose is wilting slightly, showing some brown edges on its petals.  A small, brown bird is perched on the cactus, drinking water.  The style should be whimsical and slightly naive, using soft, blended watercolor washes. The rose and cactus should maintain consistent color, shape and size throughout the painting, reflecting their character in the story." src="/posts/images/image_the-proud-rose0.png" width="1024" height="735">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene.  A large, grey boulder sits in the middle of a vibrant, yellow dirt road.  A small, round king (wearing a bright blue robe and crown, consistently sized and shaped throughout the piece), hides behind a lush, green bush.  Several figures pass by the rock: two larger, more formally dressed figures (ministers or merchants, wearing muted browns and purples, consistent size and shape) grumbling, while several smaller, more simply dressed figures (villagers) walk around the rock.  A farmer (wearing simple, earthy greens and browns, consistent size and shape), slightly larger than the villagers, is depicted in the foreground straining to push the rock with determined expression. A small golden purse, overflowing with coins, lies near the rock where it once sat. The style should be loose and expressive, emphasizing the vibrant colors and storytelling." src="/posts/images/image_the-roadblock0.png" width="1024" height="638">

The saint&rsquo;s expression remains serene throughout multiple repetitions of the rescue. In the background, a small figure of a doctor (wearing a lighter blue and white outfit) observes the scene with a surprised expression, holding a stick.  The style should be reminiscent of traditional Indian miniature paintings, emphasizing the narrative and moral lesson.

<p>To get to the market, they had to cross a river. One day, the donkey fell into the river!  Splash! The salt bags fell in too. The salt dissolved in the water, making the bags much lighter.</p> </p>
