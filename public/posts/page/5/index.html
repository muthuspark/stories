        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a story: A wealthy man, depicted in shades of deep brown and gold, with a slightly plump figure and a stern expression, is embracing his daughter, a small girl with bright pink dress and rosy cheeks, who is now turning golden.  In the background, a whimsical fairy with shimmering teal hair and gown, is partially obscured behind a gnarled, golden tree, her expression a mix of sadness and pity. The overall color palette is warm, with golds and browns contrasting against the cool teal of the fairy and the pink of the girl&rsquo;s dress. Focus on the emotional contrast between the man&rsquo;s greedy expression and the girl’s innocent, now golden, form.  Use loose, expressive watercolor brushstrokes to capture the emotional weight of the scene." src="/posts/images/image_the-greedy-man0.png" width="1024" height="712">

On the left, a gloomy, desaturated watercolor depicting the grumpy old man in dark blues and greys, his figure dominating the space, surrounded by smaller, faded figures representing the villagers avoiding him.  The right panel shows a bright, celebratory scene of the same old man, now depicted in warm, golden yellows and light oranges, radiating happiness. He&rsquo;s surrounded by cheerful villagers in vibrant hues, all significantly larger and more detailed than in the left panel.

Around him, a troop of playful monkeys, rendered in various shades of brown and beige with expressive eyes, are wearing colorful hats. Some hats are scattered on the ground, painted in vibrant blues, reds, and yellows. The background should be a soft, impressionistic wash of blues and greens, suggesting a sunny day.
