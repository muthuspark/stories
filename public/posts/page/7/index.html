                The Wicked Cat and the Mice

        <p class="line-summary"> <p>A long time ago, there was a wicked cat who always bothered lots of mice.  The mice decided they needed to solve this problem. So, they all gathered to discuss their biggest problem: this wicked cat who chased them and ate them!  &ldquo;This is chaos!&rdquo; squeaked one mouse angrily.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a lively mice council meeting.  A group of small, brown mice with large, expressive eyes are gathered in a circle, their fur rendered with delicate watercolor washes. One older, slightly larger mouse with grey fur is speaking, his paw raised. In the background, a shadowy, sleek black cat with piercing green eyes is subtly depicted, lurking just out of reach.  The overall palette is warm and earthy, with splashes of brighter color indicating the mice&rsquo;s excitement and worry. The scene is set in a cozy mouse hole, with textures suggested through loose watercolor application. Focus on conveying the mice&rsquo;s anxious energy and the cat&rsquo;s ominous presence. Style: whimsical, slightly naive watercolor." src="/posts/images/image_the-wicked-cat-and-the-mice0.png" width="1024" height="537">

<p>The guard wondered who this sadhu was and why he claimed to be the king&rsquo;s brother.  He thought maybe it was a distant relative who had become a sadhu.  The guard told the king, who smiled and said, &ldquo;Let the sadhu in.&rdquo;</p> </p>

The darker figure is subtly positioned in the center, looking anxious amidst the other four Brahmins who are gathered around a small pile of sparkling jewel-toned watercolors. The scene is set against a rich background of deep greens and browns, suggestive of a jungle setting.  The overall mood is one of suspense and intrigue, with a focus on the facial expressions of the Brahmins. The jewel colors should be vibrant and reflective, suggesting the precious nature of the stolen gems.

<p>In the jungle of Ajanar, lived two strong lions, Shursingh and Singraj. Shursingh was getting old and couldn&rsquo;t hunt anymore.</p>
<p>Singraj would hunt for him and bring him food.  When Singraj went hunting, Shursingh was all alone.  The other animals were too scared to go near him.</p>
<p>One day, a pack of jackals saw Shursingh alone.  They thought they found a big meal! They surrounded him and bit him, hurting him badly. Shursingh fainted.</p> </p>
