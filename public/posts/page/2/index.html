One is partially submerged in a river, clinging to a leaf, while another is attempting a rescue. The camel is partially visible in the background. The overall tone should convey the tragicomedy of their actions.  Use flowing brushstrokes to capture the movement of the water and the desperation of the scene. Use dark and light values to convey emotion." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-four-learned-fools1.png" width="1024" height="737">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of four friends, consistently sized and shaped, each a different muted color (e.g., pale blue, dusty rose, soft yellow, muted green), traveling through a lush, vibrant landscape. One friend is kneeling beside a pile of shimmering copper coins. Another is examining a glittering silver ingot. A third stands near a mound of gold, looking conflicted. The fourth friend, smaller and drawn with slightly darker, sharper lines, has a spinning wheel on his head, with a dark, mysterious figure standing slightly behind him, while another friend watches sorrowfully from the background. The overall style should be whimsical but with a touch of melancholy. The background should include hints of the wise Yogi in the distance, barely visible amongst the foliage." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-four-treasure-seekers0.png" width="1024" height="888">

Several bright green frogs, one noticeably larger representing the frog king, gather around him, showing concern. In the background, a dark looming mountain under a slightly ominous, muted sky adds a sense of foreboding.

<p>Once upon a time, near a big mountain, lived a very old snake named Mandavishya. He was so old he couldn&rsquo;t catch frogs to eat!  He thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too weak to hunt. I need a new plan!&rdquo;</p> </p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Miss Mackenzie walking on a winding, red-earth path through the lush Indian hills towards a distant, hazy town shimmering in the heat. The sun beats down, casting dappled shadows through the dense foliage. She is carrying a worn, woven basket overflowing with fresh fruits and vegetables, her back slightly stooped from the weight. She&rsquo;s wearing a long, floral-patterned dress, its fabric faded and patched in places, and a wide-brimmed straw hat providing shade. The landscape is vibrantly green, with glimpses of crumbling, old, dilapidated houses through the thick trees. Birds of paradise and bright bougainvillea add pops of color. The air is thick with the sound of cicadas." src="/posts/images/image_ruskin-goodbye-miss-mackenzie1.png" width="1024" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor painting of the final scene: A lonely, emaciated brown cobra lies coiled at the bottom of a deserted well, surrounded by the shadows of past victims. A few wilting water plants suggest the passage of time and the cobra&rsquo;s despair. Gangadatta, a small green figure, is shown in the far distance, happily hopping away, silhouetted against a vibrant sunset. This image should emphasize the cobra&rsquo;s isolation and the moral of the story. Employ a palette of muted browns, greens, and oranges, with a strong contrast between the dark well and the bright sunset." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-greedy-cobra-and-king-of-frogs2.png" width="776" height="1024">
