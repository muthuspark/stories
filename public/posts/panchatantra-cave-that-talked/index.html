        <img loading="lazy" alt="A single watercolor painting depicting Kharanakhara, a large, ochre-colored lion, with a dark mane and tail, peeking out from a dark, damp cave.  His expression is slightly anxious.  Outside, a smaller, clever-looking jackal, a light reddish-brown, with sharp features, is shown just outside the cave entrance, looking at the lion with a mixture of suspicion and relief, having just heard the lion’s roar. The background is a wash of cool blues and purples for the twilight sky and darker greens for the jungle foliage.  The lion and jackal&rsquo;s size and color palette should remain consistent." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-cave-that-talked2.png" width="1024" height="799">

<p>Kharanakhara was a lion who lived in the jungle.  One day, he was very, very hungry! He looked and looked for food, but he couldn&rsquo;t find anything.  The sun was going down, and he was still hungry.</p>
<p>On his way home, he saw a big cave.  He thought, &ldquo;Maybe an animal lives in there! I&rsquo;ll hide and wait for my dinner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cave was home to a clever jackal.  The jackal came home and saw lion footprints going into the cave, but none coming out! He thought, &ldquo;A lion is in there!  But how can I be sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jackal had a clever idea. He stood outside the cave and called, &ldquo;Hello Cave! Hello Cave! Can I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited, then called again, &ldquo;Hello Cave!  We always say hello to each other! Why are you quiet today?  I&rsquo;ll go to a different cave if you don&rsquo;t answer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion thought, &ldquo;The cave usually answers the jackal.  It&rsquo;s quiet because I&rsquo;m here! I need to answer, or the jackal will leave!&rdquo;  So the lion roared, &ldquo;Hello Jackal, you can come in! It&rsquo;s safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion&rsquo;s roar echoed loudly in the cave! The jackal heard it and knew the lion was waiting for him.  He ran away as fast as he could!</p>
<p>The wise say:  It&rsquo;s good to be clever and keep yourself safe!</p>
