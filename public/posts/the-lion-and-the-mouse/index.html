        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting two distinct scenes:  In the first, a sleepy, golden-orange lion with a consistent shape and size rests in a vibrant, green jungle setting painted with loose, wet-on-wet watercolor technique.  A small, light brown mouse, consistently sized and shaped, playfully runs over the lion. In the second scene, the same lion is captured in a rough, dark brown net tied to a textured, light brown tree. The same little brown mouse is diligently chewing on the net. The watercolor style should emphasize texture and movement, with soft, blended colors and detailed expressions in both the lion and the mouse. Maintain consistent coloring and shapes for the characters throughout." src="/posts/images/image_the-lion-and-the-mouse1.png" width="730" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, a lion was sleeping in the jungle.  While the lion was sleeping, a little mouse started playing on the lion&rsquo;s body, running and jumping all over him! This woke the lion up, and he was very angry.</p>
<p>The angry lion caught the mouse.  Just as the lion was about to eat the mouse, the mouse quickly begged the lion to let him go. The mouse promised that if the lion ever needed help, he would do everything he could to help.</p>
<p>The lion found the mouse&rsquo;s bravery funny, so he laughed and let the mouse go.</p>
<p>A few months later, some hunters came to the jungle. They caught the lion in a net and tied him to a tree! The lion tried very hard to free himself, but he couldn&rsquo;t.  He roared loudly in frustration.</p>
<p>His roar was heard far away. A little mouse was passing by, and when he heard the lion&rsquo;s roar, he knew the lion was in trouble.</p>
<p>As soon as the mouse reached the lion, he started to gnaw on the net with his sharp teeth.  Soon, the lion was free!</p>
<p>The lion thanked the mouse, and they both went off happily together into the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson of the story:</strong> This story teaches us to help each other and not to hurt anyone without reason.</p>
