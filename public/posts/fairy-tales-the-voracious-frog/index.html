        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration, early morning in a lush, overgrown jungle. Soft, diffused sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. A determined-looking rat, fur a warm ochre brown, carries a burlap sack heavy with flour and a glass bottle of milk. The sack is dusted with flour and slightly torn. A bright green frog, with bulging eyes, hops excitedly alongside, struggling under the weight of a bundle of dry, twiggy sticks, easily taller than itself, precariously balanced on its back with twine. Dewdrops cling to the large jungle leaves. Color palette: predominantly greens and browns with accents of white, ochre, and the bright green of the frog. Creates a feeling of hopeful adventure." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog0.png" width="1024" height="722">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a rat and a frog. The rat said to the frog, &ldquo;Hey, can you go get some sticks? I&rsquo;ll go get flour and milk!&rdquo; So the frog hopped off into the jungle and brought back lots of sticks. The rat went and got flour and milk for their yummy dinner.</p>
<p>Then, the rat cooked everything up! When it was ready, she said to the frog, &ldquo;Okay, you sit here and watch the food while I go take a bath. Make sure nobody sneaks in and eats it!&rdquo; The rat went to take her bath, but as soon as she was gone, the frog gobbled up all the dinner super fast and hopped away!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a cozy jungle clearing at dusk. Warm, inviting light emanates from a small cooking fire. The rat, now wearing a slightly singed and flour-dusted miniature apron, is intently stirring a bubbling pot suspended over the flames. Steam rises, carrying the aroma of sweet bread. The frog sits nearby on a mossy log, eyes wide, practically bulging, and intensely fixated on the pot with a hungry, almost desperate expression. Tiny droplets of saliva gleam on its tongue. Color palette: warm oranges, yellows, and reds from the firelight, contrasted with the cool greens of the surrounding jungle. The air feels thick with anticipation." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog1.png" width="1024" height="722">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: the frog, eyes wide with panic and a hint of guilt, rapidly hops away from a scorched and empty cooking pot next to a dying fire. Embers glow weakly. Small, colorful splashes of unidentified food remnants – crumbs of bread, splatters of milk – are visible around the pot, suggesting a disastrous feast. The jungle is lush and dense in the background, blurring into a wash of greens and browns to emphasize the frog&rsquo;s hasty retreat. Color palette: muted browns, grays, and greens, reflecting the ruined meal and the frog&rsquo;s shame. Creates a sense of comedic chaos and regret." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog2.png" width="1024" height="721">

</p>
<p>When the rat came back, the dinner was gone! And the frog was gone too! She went to look for him, calling out as loud as she could. She saw him way off in the distance and ran to catch up. &ldquo;Why did you eat my dinner? Why did you run away?&rdquo; asked the rat.</p>
<p>

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 626;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration, mid-afternoon in a dense jungle. Sunlight cuts sharply through the leaves, creating strong shadows. The rat stands on a winding jungle path, its fur ruffled and dirty, looking distraught and holding its tiny hands up in exasperation. Its ears are drooped, and its whiskers twitch with frustration. In the distance, a small green frog hops away, viewed from the back, its form diminishing into the foliage. The path is strewn with discarded leaves and small stones. Color palette: varying shades of green, brown, and grey, highlighting the contrast between the rat&rsquo;s despair and the frog&rsquo;s carefree departure. An atmosphere of quiet disappointment." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog3.png" width="1024" height="626">

</p>
<p>The frog said, &ldquo;Oh no! It wasn&rsquo;t me! A giant dog came and ate your dinner! I&rsquo;m just a tiny, tiny frog, and he was a huge, big dog! He scared me, so I ran away!&rdquo; &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; said the rat. &ldquo;Go get me more sticks while I get more flour and milk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, the frog hopped back into the jungle and brought back even more sticks! The rat went to get flour and milk again. Then, she made a fire and cooked another dinner! She told the frog to watch the food while she took another bath. But as soon as she left, the frog ate up all the dinner again! Then he hopped away and hid.</p>
<p>When the rat came back, there was no frog and no dinner! She went into the jungle and called out to him. The frog answered from behind a tree, &ldquo;Here I am! Here I am!&rdquo; The rat went to him and said, &ldquo;Why did you eat my dinner again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the frog. &ldquo;It was that great big dog! He ate the dinner, and he even tried to eat me! That&rsquo;s why I ran away!&rdquo; The rat said, &ldquo;Okay, fine. Go get me more sticks, and I&rsquo;ll go get more flour and milk.&rdquo; Then she cooked dinner <em>again</em> and went to take a bath. The frog ate up <em>all</em> the dinner and went to hide again!</p>
<p>When the rat came back, there was no dinner and no frog. So she went way out into the jungle, found the frog, and told him, &ldquo;I know it was you who ate the dinner!&rdquo;</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: a round, VERY plump frog sits comically concealed behind a gigantic tree, its rough bark textured with moss and lichen. Only its head and front legs are visible. Its expression is sly, mischievous, and slightly smug. A ridiculously small baker&rsquo;s hat sits askew on top of the frog&rsquo;s head, almost too small to stay on. Bright, dappled sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dancing highlights on its skin. Color palette: a range of greens, browns, and yellows, with the frog&rsquo;s skin appearing almost iridescent in the dappled light. Conveys a sense of hidden gluttony and playful deception." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog4.png" width="728" height="1024">

</p>
<p>The frog said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and the rat said, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; And the frog said, &ldquo;If you say that again, I&rsquo;m going to eat you up!&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said the rat, &ldquo;eat me up then!&rdquo; So, the frog ate her up and sat behind a tree. Then, a baker walked by.</p>
<p>The frog called out, &ldquo;Baker! Come here! Come here! Give me some bread!&rdquo; The baker looked all around, but he couldn&rsquo;t see anyone. He couldn&rsquo;t figure out who was calling him! Finally, he saw the frog sitting behind the tree. &ldquo;Give me some bread!&rdquo; said the frog. The baker said, &ldquo;No way! I&rsquo;m a big, strong baker, and you&rsquo;re just a little frog! And you don&rsquo;t have any money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do! I&rsquo;ll give you some coins, and you&rsquo;ll give me some bread!&rdquo; said the frog. But the baker said, &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the frog, &ldquo;if you won&rsquo;t give me bread, I&rsquo;ll eat <em>you</em> up first, and <em>then</em> I&rsquo;ll eat your bread!&rdquo; So, he ate up the baker, and then he ate up all his bread!</p>
<p>Soon after, a man with oranges and lemons walked by. The frog called to him, &ldquo;Come here! Come here!&rdquo; The man was really scared. He didn&rsquo;t know who had called him! Then he saw the frog, and the frog said, &ldquo;Give me some lemons!&rdquo; The man wouldn&rsquo;t and said, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay then!&rdquo; said the frog, &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll eat you up!&rdquo; So, he ate up the man with his lemons and oranges!</p>
<p>Next, a horse and his groom walked by. The frog said, &ldquo;Please give me a ride, and I&rsquo;ll give you some money!&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the horse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you ride on me! You&rsquo;re like a tiny monkey - I won&rsquo;t let you ride on my back!&rdquo; The frog said, &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll eat you up!&rdquo; Then the frog ate him up and his groom too!</p>
<p>After that, a barber walked by. &ldquo;Come and shave me!&rdquo; said the frog. &ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; said the barber. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and shave you!&rdquo; So he shaved him. He thought the frog looked <em>very</em> fat! So, while he was shaving him, he suddenly made a little cut in his tummy! Out jumped the rat with her flour and milk! And the baker with his bread! And the lemon-seller with his oranges and lemons! And the horse and his groom! The barber ran away home! And the frog was all empty and he died.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration, a bizarre and chaotic scene filled with motion. The barber, a small, almost insectile figure with spectacles perched on his nose, looks on with pure horror and shock as his razor, a shining silver blade, accidentally slices into the enormous frog&rsquo;s distended stomach. A torrent of objects and even people explode outwards, thrown into the air. Oranges, lemons, loaves of crusty bread, splashing milk, a cloud of flour, the disgruntled rat, and a panicked groom (complete with top hat and tails) are all caught in mid-air. The barber&rsquo;s shop tools and shaving cream are also flying around the scene. Color palette: a riot of bright, contrasting colors, emphasizing the absurdity and chaos of the situation. Creates a surreal and slightly unsettling feeling." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog5.png" width="1024" height="746">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: a very large, dead frog lies sprawled on its back in the heart of the jungle. Its limbs are splayed at awkward angles, its mouth hangs open revealing a pink tongue, and its eyes are lifeless and glazed over. The surrounding jungle is detailed with lush foliage, but the vibrant greens are muted by the overcast sky. The sky is grey and heavy with impending rain. Dew clings to the leaves. Color palette: muted greens, browns, and grays dominate, reflecting the somber mood. A sense of finality and decay pervades the scene." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-voracious-frog6.png" width="1024" height="636">
