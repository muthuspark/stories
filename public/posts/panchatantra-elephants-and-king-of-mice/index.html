        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene: a crumbling, earth-toned village with broken houses, tiny brown mice scurrying around, large grey elephants walking carefully along a different path towards a serene blue lake.  The mouse king, slightly larger than the other mice but still tiny, is shown talking to a large elephant king, who looks kindly down at him.  The background features soft blues and greens reflecting the lake and surrounding landscape.  Focus on creating a light, airy, and slightly whimsical feel using soft watercolor washes." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-elephants-and-king-of-mice0.png" width="1024" height="574">

<p>A long, long time ago, a big earthquake shook a village!  The houses fell down, and everyone moved away.</p>
<p>But guess what?  Lots and lots of tiny mice moved into the broken houses. They made it their new home!</p>
<p>Nearby was a lake.  Big, big elephants went to the lake every day for a drink and a bath.  To get to the lake, they walked right through the old village where the mice lived.</p>
<p>Oops!  The elephants were so big, they accidentally stepped on lots of mice!</p>
<p>The mouse king decided to do something. He went to talk to the elephant king.  &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he squeaked, &ldquo;your herd is hurting my people. Could you please walk a different way to the lake? I&rsquo;ll remember your kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant king chuckled.  &ldquo;Little mice,&rdquo; he boomed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re so big, we don&rsquo;t need your help! But okay, we&rsquo;ll take another path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephants took a new route. But then, oh no!  The elephants got caught in hunter&rsquo;s traps!  The nets were strong, and they couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>The elephant king remembered the mouse king&rsquo;s promise! He sent another elephant to ask for help.</p>
<p>The mouse king called all his mice.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to help our friends!&rdquo; he squeaked.  The tiny mice scurried to the traps and nibbled and nibbled on the strong nets until they were all loose!</p>
<p>The elephants were free! They thanked the mice.  The elephant king and the mouse king became the best of friends.</p>
<p>Remember:  Even the littlest creatures can be very helpful!</p>
