<p>Once upon a time, a big, mean lion named Bhasuraka ruled the jungle. He was very scary and killed lots of animals!</p>
<p>One day, all the animals went to Bhasuraka and said, &ldquo;Please, Mr. Lion! You kill too many of us.  Just one animal a day is enough for you to eat. Let&rsquo;s make a deal: we&rsquo;ll give you one animal each day, and you won&rsquo;t hunt anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bhasuraka agreed, but warned, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get an animal every day, I&rsquo;ll kill you all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animals picked one animal each day by drawing straws.  Everyone felt safe, except for the animal chosen that day.</p>
<p>One day, a little hare was picked.  He didn&rsquo;t want to be eaten! He walked super slowly to the lion&rsquo;s den.</p>
<p>On the way, he saw a deep well.  He looked inside and saw his own reflection.  He had a great idea!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trick the lion!&rdquo; he thought.  He walked even slower.</p>
<p>Finally, he got to the den.  Bhasuraka was very hungry and angry! He waited all day for his meal.</p>
<p>He was ready to eat the hare and then all the other animals.  But the hare bowed and said, &ldquo;Mr. Lion, please listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; roared the lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was supposed to be your meal,&rdquo; said the hare, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m too small!  Four other hares came with me, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; growled Bhasuraka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;on the way, we met another lion! He said HE was the king of the jungle! He wanted us all. He said, &lsquo;Fight me! Whoever is stronger is the king!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; roared Bhasuraka.  &ldquo;Take me to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hare said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a very strong den.  He&rsquo;s very strong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bhasuraka was so angry, he didn&rsquo;t listen.  The hare led him to the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other lion is in there!&rdquo; said the hare, pointing to the well.</p>
<p>Bhasuraka looked into the well.  He saw his own reflection! He thought it was the other lion.</p>
<p>He roared at his reflection!  The roar bounced back from the well.</p>
<p>Bhasuraka was so mad, he jumped into the well to fight his reflection!  He fell in and drowned!</p>
<p>The hare was so happy!  He ran back to the other animals, who cheered and celebrated his cleverness.  They all lived happily ever after in the jungle!</p>
