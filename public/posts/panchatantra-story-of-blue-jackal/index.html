        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene: Chandarava, a small jackal consistently colored a vibrant blue, stands proudly amidst a group of larger, diverse jungle animals (lions, tigers, deer, etc.) who look at him with a mix of awe and slight suspicion.  The background is a lush, green jungle with a hint of a village in the distance.  The overall style is playful yet slightly apprehensive, reflecting the story&rsquo;s tone. The blue dye is subtly splashed around Chandarava, indicating his recent escape." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-story-of-blue-jackal0.png" width="818" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a clever jackal named Chandarava.  He was very hungry one day and couldn&rsquo;t find any food!</p>
<p>So, Chandarava went to a village to look for something to eat.  But the village dogs saw him!  Woof woof! They barked and chased him.</p>
<p>Chandarava ran and ran! He zoomed into a washerman&rsquo;s house.  There was a big tub of blue dye!  Splash!  Chandarava jumped in and got covered in blue paint. He didn&rsquo;t look like a jackal anymore!</p>
<p>When the dogs saw him, all blue, they were scared!  They didn&rsquo;t know what he was and ran away!</p>
<p>Chandarava went back to the jungle.  He was still blue!  All the other animals were scared of the blue jackal. They thought he was a scary new animal!</p>
<p>Chandarava had an idea! He shouted, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!  I&rsquo;m the new king!  Brahma, the great god, made me king! I&rsquo;m here to protect you all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animals believed him! They became his subjects. Chandarava told everyone what to do.  He didn&rsquo;t want to be near other jackals though, because he didn&rsquo;t want them to know he was really a jackal.</p>
<p>The lions and tigers hunted for food for Chandarava. He shared the food with everyone.  He was a good king, for a while.</p>
<p>One night, Chandarava heard other jackals howling. He couldn&rsquo;t help it! He started howling too!  The animals heard him and realized he was just a trickster jackal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fooled us!&rdquo; they cried. They were very angry.  They chased Chandarava and gave him a good scolding!</p>
<p>The story teaches us: It&rsquo;s not good to trick your friends.  Be kind and honest!</p>
