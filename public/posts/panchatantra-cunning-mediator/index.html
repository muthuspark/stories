<p>Two little birds, Pip and Pop, lived in a big tree in the jungle. Pip lived in a cozy branch, and Pop lived in a hole at the bottom of the tree.  They were best friends and loved to chat.</p>
<p>One day, Pip flew away with other birds to find yummy food.  Pop waited and waited, but Pip didn&rsquo;t come back. Pop was worried!  He thought, &ldquo;Where is Pip?  I hope he&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Days went by, and Pop still didn&rsquo;t see Pip.  Pop felt sad.  Then, a bunny named Floppy came along and saw the empty hole.  Floppy moved in!</p>
<p>Finally, Pip came home! He had found lots of yummy berries.  He was happy to be back, but then he saw Floppy in his hole!  &ldquo;Hey! This is my home!&rdquo; Pip cried.</p>
<p>Floppy said, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s my home now! I found it empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pip and Floppy argued.  Pip said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask a wise animal to help!&rdquo; Floppy agreed.</p>
<p>They found a cat who pretended to be very wise. He sat by a river, holding a special grass, and pretended to be praying.</p>
<p>Pip and Floppy thought he was a holy cat.  They told him their problem, but Pip said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay far away. He&rsquo;s still a cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cat pretended to be kind. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very peaceful. Come closer, I can&rsquo;t hear you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pip and Floppy trusted him and came close.  But the sneaky cat jumped up and caught them!  He ate them both!</p>
<p>The story teaches us: Be careful of people who pretend to be good but are not.</p>
