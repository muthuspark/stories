<p>Once upon a time, near a big lake full of yummy fish, lived a very old heron.  He was so old, he couldn&rsquo;t catch fish anymore! He got very, very hungry.</p>
<p>He thought and thought, then he had a sneaky plan. He sat by the lake and pretended to cry.</p>
<p>A little crab saw him and asked, &ldquo;Uncle Heron, what&rsquo;s wrong? Why are you crying instead of catching fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heron pretended, &ldquo;Little crab, I&rsquo;m too old! I&rsquo;m giving up fishing and going on a hunger strike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crab asked, &ldquo;But why are you crying if you&rsquo;re giving up everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the heron, &ldquo;I heard from a wise owl that the lake will dry up in twelve years! There won&rsquo;t be any rain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crab was scared! He told all the other fish and water creatures. They believed the heron because he wasn&rsquo;t trying to catch any fish.</p>
<p>They asked the heron, &ldquo;Please help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heron said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another lake, far away! It&rsquo;s full of water and pretty flowers.  I can carry you there on my back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heron tricked them! He carried one creature at a time, flew a little way, then smashed them on a rock and ate them!  He&rsquo;d then go back and tell lies about how happy they were in the new lake.</p>
<p>One day, it was the crab&rsquo;s turn.  As the heron flew, the crab looked down and saw a pile of bones! He knew the heron&rsquo;s secret!</p>
<p>The crab said, &ldquo;Uncle, I&rsquo;m heavy. Let&rsquo;s rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heron said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other lake! I&rsquo;m going to eat you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the crab was clever! He grabbed the heron&rsquo;s neck with his strong claws and squeezed! The heron couldn&rsquo;t breathe and died.</p>
<p>The crab took the heron back to the lake and told everyone the truth.  The lake wasn&rsquo;t going to dry up!  The heron was a bad guy!</p>
<p>The crab was a hero! He saved everyone from the sneaky heron.  So remember, kids:  If something seems wrong, use your smarts to figure it out!</p>
