        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: A single scene depicting a tranquil pond.  Two large, orange-pink fish (Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi) are struggling in a fishing net, while a smaller, bright green frog (Ekabuddhi) observes from a distance, perched on a lily pad with his family of smaller green frogs. The pond is filled with water lilies, and the overall style should be peaceful yet hinting at the underlying tension of the story." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-tale-of-two-fishes-and-frog1.png" width="1024" height="574">

<p>Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi were two big, friendly fish.  Their best friend was a frog named Ekabuddhi. They all loved hanging out by their pond.</p>
<p>One day, some fishermen walked by.  The fishermen had nets and baskets full of fish they&rsquo;d already caught. They saw the pond and said, &ldquo;Wow! This pond is full of fish! Let&rsquo;s come back tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ekabuddhi the frog was worried.  He said, &ldquo;My friends! We need to hide! The fishermen will be back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi weren&rsquo;t scared. Sahasrabuddhi said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m a great swimmer! I can easily escape!&rdquo; Satabuddhi agreed, &ldquo;Me too! We&rsquo;re not leaving our home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ekabuddhi was still scared, so he decided to take his family to a different pond to be safe.</p>
<p>The next morning, the fishermen returned. They threw their nets into the pond and caught lots of fish!  Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi tried to swim away, but they were caught. They were so big, the fishermen showed them off proudly.</p>
<p>Ekabuddhi and his family were safe in their new pond.  He was sad to see his friends gone, but he knew he did the right thing. He told his wife, &ldquo;My friends were great swimmers, but they didn&rsquo;t listen to their friend’s warning.  I’m happy to be safe with my family. It&rsquo;s good to listen when you hear danger is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end.</p>
