        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene: A tired hat seller, depicted with warm earth tones and simple features,  rests under a large, leafy green tree.  Around him, a troop of playful monkeys, rendered in various shades of brown and beige with expressive eyes, are wearing colorful hats. Some hats are scattered on the ground, painted in vibrant blues, reds, and yellows. The background should be a soft, impressionistic wash of blues and greens, suggesting a sunny day. Focus on light and shadow to emphasize the whimsical and charming nature of the scene. The style should be loose and expressive, characteristic of watercolor." src="/posts/images/image_the-hat-seller-and-the-monkeys0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>A long time ago, in a village, lived a hat seller. He would travel to nearby villages to sell his hats.  One day, after selling hats for a few days, he was returning home.</p>
<p>He was carrying many hats and was very tired from standing and traveling. He thought, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I rest under a tree for a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found a big, shady tree and decided to take a nap. He thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a short sleep and then walk quickly to the village!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon, the hat seller fell fast asleep. After hours, he woke up with a start! He looked around and saw that all his hats were gone, except for one!  &ldquo;My hats! My hats! Who could have taken them?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Then he heard some chattering sounds from above!  &ldquo;Ah, the monkeys!&rdquo; he wailed. He thought he would never get his hats back.</p>
<p>He started thinking of a plan to get his hats back.  Then he had an idea!</p>
<p>He picked up his one remaining hat and put it on.  The monkeys, watching him, also put on their hats!  Then he took off his hat and threw it on the ground.  Seeing this, all the monkeys took off their hats and threw them down too! The hat seller quickly picked up all the hats and rushed back to his village.</p>
<p>In this way, the clever hat seller got all his hats back!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Always be clever and think carefully about what you do, so you can solve even difficult problems!</p>
