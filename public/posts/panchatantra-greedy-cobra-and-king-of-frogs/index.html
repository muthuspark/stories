        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor painting of the final scene: A lonely, emaciated brown cobra lies coiled at the bottom of a deserted well, surrounded by the shadows of past victims. A few wilting water plants suggest the passage of time and the cobra&rsquo;s despair. Gangadatta, a small green figure, is shown in the far distance, happily hopping away, silhouetted against a vibrant sunset. This image should emphasize the cobra&rsquo;s isolation and the moral of the story. Employ a palette of muted browns, greens, and oranges, with a strong contrast between the dark well and the bright sunset." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-greedy-cobra-and-king-of-frogs2.png" width="776" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, a frog named Gangadatta was the king of all the frogs in a well!  But his frog relatives were always bothering him.  He was so tired of them, he climbed out of the well one day and left!</p>
<p>Gangadatta wanted revenge on his annoying relatives. Then, he saw a big snake slithering into a hole! He had a sneaky plan.</p>
<p>He called out to the snake, &ldquo;Hello! I&rsquo;m the frog king! Let&rsquo;s be friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snake was a cobra, and cobras eat frogs! He was very suspicious. &ldquo;Are you trying to trick me? Frogs and snakes are enemies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gangadatta said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, but I want to get back at my bad relatives.  You can eat all the frogs in my well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cobra asked, &ldquo;How will I get in? I don&rsquo;t have legs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gangadatta said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cozy hole near the water. I&rsquo;ll show you!  But promise you&rsquo;ll only eat my mean relatives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old cobra was hungry, so he agreed.  Gangadatta led him to the hole. The cobra ate and ate, gobbling up all the annoying frogs!</p>
<p>Soon, only Gangadatta and his nice frog friends were left. The cobra was still hungry! &ldquo;There are no more bad frogs!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gangadatta was scared. The cobra ate all his friends! Only Gangadatta was left.</p>
<p>Gangadatta promised to bring more frogs from other wells.  The cobra, being greedy, let him go. But Gangadatta never came back!</p>
<p>The cobra waited and waited, until he asked a lizard to send a message to Gangadatta.  Gangadatta replied, &ldquo;Tell the cobra I&rsquo;m never coming back!  A hungry cobra is very dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The greedy cobra starved in the well.  The story teaches us: It&rsquo;s best to solve your own problems!</p>
