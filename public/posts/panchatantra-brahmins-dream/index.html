        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting depicting Swabhavakripna waking up from his dream. His face displays disappointment, painted in soft blues and greys. Next to him, the broken clay pot is visible with spilled porridge.  In a semi-transparent overlay above him, fainter watercolors illustrate scenes from his dream: a rich, bustling landscape with happy animals (goats, cows, buffaloes, horses) and a large house, all rendered in warmer colors, showcasing the wealth and family he dreamt of. Soma Sharma, a small, brightly colored figure, is clearly seen amongst the animals, creating a sense of happy chaos. The scene should depict the stark contrast between the reality of poverty and the fleeting richness of the dream." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-brahmins-dream2.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, in a small village, lived a poor man named Swabhavakripna. He had no friends and had to beg for food.  He was a bit of a saver, keeping all his food in a clay pot next to his bed. He only ate when he was very, very hungry.</p>
<p>One day, he got lots of yummy rice porridge! He filled his pot and ate some. He was so happy to see his full pot; he couldn&rsquo;t stop looking at it even when he went to sleep.</p>
<p>He started dreaming! In his dream, he sold the porridge for lots and lots of money. He bought goats, then those goats had baby goats! He traded the goats for cows and buffaloes.  The cows and buffaloes had babies too, and gave lots of milk!</p>
<p>He sold the milk and became very rich! He even bought a big house and some horses! A rich man gave him his daughter to marry, and they had a son named Soma Sharma.</p>
<p>But Soma was a very naughty boy! He made lots of noise. One day, Swabhavakripna got angry and shouted at him. In his dream, he kicked, and guess what? He kicked his clay pot!  The pot broke, and all the porridge spilled!</p>
<p>He woke up!  It was all a dream! All his porridge was gone.  He was very sad.</p>
<p>This shows us: It&rsquo;s not good to dream about things that aren&rsquo;t real!</p>
