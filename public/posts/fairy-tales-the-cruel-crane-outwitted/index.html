        <img loading="lazy" alt="A serene and slightly melancholic watercolor illustration of a lush forest scene at twilight. Soft, golden light filters through the canopy, creating long, dappled shadows. A gentle, glowing tree spirit with a kindly, yet worried face, stands near a pond filled with vibrant, fading lotus flowers. The pond&rsquo;s water level is noticeably low, exposing muddy banks and cracked earth. Several fish with large, expressive eyes swim nervously near the surface, their scales shimmering with iridescent hues. The air is thick with humidity, and the scent of damp earth hangs heavy. Artistic style: detailed watercolor with soft blending and a touch of whimsy." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>A long, long time ago, there was a special tree spirit who lived in the forest. He was like a friendly protector for all the trees. This spirit lived near a pond full of beautiful lotus flowers.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes when it didn&rsquo;t rain for a while, the water in the pond would start to disappear. There were lots of fish living in that pond, and they started to worry.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 738;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a sneaky-looking crane with ruffled feathers, perched at the edge of a drying pond under the harsh midday sun. The crane&rsquo;s sharp, intelligent eyes are narrowed as it observes a group of worried fish huddled together. The pond is surrounded by dry, cracking green reeds and faded, tattered lily pads. Patches of bare, sun-baked mud are visible. The color palette leans towards earthy browns and muted greens, conveying a sense of desperation and drought. Artistic style: loose watercolor technique with emphasis on texture and detail." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted1.png" width="1024" height="738">

</figure>
</p>
<p>One day, a crane saw the fish looking sad. The crane was a sneaky bird, and he thought, &ldquo;Hmm, I bet I can trick those fish and have them for lunch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, he sat down by the edge of the pond and pretended to be deep in thought, trying to come up with a plan.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 721;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the crane, with a feigned look of concern and compassion, talking to the group of fish under a cloudy, overcast sky. The crane&rsquo;s neck is slightly arched, and its feathers are subtly puffed out to appear larger. The fish are looking up at the crane with wide, anxious eyes, displaying anxiety and desperation. Bubbles rise from their mouths as they gasp for air. The water is murky and stagnant. Hints of vibrant green algae cling to the exposed pond bed. Artistic style: soft watercolor wash with subtle shading to emphasize the fish&rsquo;s distress." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted2.png" width="1024" height="721">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The fish saw the crane and asked, &ldquo;Hey, Mr. Crane, why are you sitting there looking so worried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just thinking about you,&rdquo; the crane said, trying to sound caring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking about us? What about us?&rdquo; the fish asked, getting curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the crane said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much water left in this pond, and hardly any food for you to eat. And it&rsquo;s getting so hot! I was just wondering, what will you all do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right! What are we going to do?&rdquo; the fish said, feeling even more worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you promise to do what I say, I can help!&rdquo; the crane said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry you in my beak, one by one, to a big, amazing pond filled with all sorts of pretty lotus flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fish were surprised. &ldquo;A crane helping fish? That&rsquo;s never happened before! We thought you wanted to eat us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; the crane said. &ldquo;As long as you trust me, I won&rsquo;t eat you. But if you don&rsquo;t believe me about the pond, send one of you with me to check it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fish thought about it and decided to trust him. They picked a big fish with one bad eye, thinking he was smart enough to handle anything.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the crane flying an old, one-eyed fish with tattered fins over the dense forest canopy, bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The fish looks excited and hopeful, its remaining eye gleaming with anticipation. The crane&rsquo;s face is partially obscured by the fish&rsquo;s body and its own wing, a shadow falling across its beak, hinting at deception. The wind ruffles the crane&rsquo;s feathers and causes the fish&rsquo;s fins to flutter. The forest below is a tapestry of greens, browns, and oranges. Artistic style: dynamic watercolor with strong lighting and contrasting colors to create a sense of movement and suspense." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted3.png" width="1024" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The crane took the one-eyed fish to the new pond, let him swim around and see how wonderful it was, and then brought him back to the others. The one-eyed fish told everyone about the amazing pond, with its clear water and beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Mr. Crane! You can take us there!&rdquo; the fish all said, excited.</p>
<p>So, the crane started with the old one-eyed fish. He flew him to the new pond, but instead of dropping him in the water, he landed in a tree by the pond. He threw the fish into a branch, pecked him to death, ate him, and then threw the bones on the ground.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 699; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration showing the crane perched in a gnarled, ancient tree near a pond full of thriving lotus flowers, bathed in the soft morning light. A pile of meticulously arranged fish bones glistens under the tree, partially hidden by fallen leaves. The pond has calm, clear water, reflecting the blue sky and fluffy white clouds above. The color palette is vibrant and peaceful, contrasting with the gruesome reality hidden beneath the tree. The air is fresh and clean. Artistic style: detailed watercolor with a focus on capturing the beauty of nature and the subtle horror of the scene." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted4.png" width="699" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>Then he flew back to the old pond and called out, &ldquo;I dropped that fish off! Who&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did this over and over, taking all the fish one by one, eating them, and throwing their bones under the tree! Finally, there were no fish left in the pond!</p>
<p>But there was still a crab hiding in the mud. The crane decided he wanted to eat the crab too. &ldquo;Hey, Mr. Crab!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken all the fish to a wonderful new pond. Why don&rsquo;t you come too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you carry me?&rdquo; the crab asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you in my beak,&rdquo; the crane said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do that, you might drop me! I don&rsquo;t want to go!&rdquo; the crab said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! I&rsquo;ll hold you tight!&rdquo; the crane promised.</p>
<p>Then the crab thought to himself, &ldquo;If this crane catches me, he&rsquo;ll probably eat me! But if he really takes me to the pond, that would be great! If he tries to trick me, I&rsquo;ll squeeze his neck!&rdquo; So he said to the crane:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Mr. Crane, you might not be able to hold me tight enough. But we crabs have super strong claws! If you let me grab onto your neck with my claws, I&rsquo;d be happy to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crane didn&rsquo;t realize the crab was trying to trick him, and he agreed! So the crab grabbed the crane&rsquo;s neck with his claws, squeezing as hard as he could. &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; the crab shouted.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 666;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the crane holding a crab by the neck with its beak, mid-flight. The crab is gripping the crane&rsquo;s neck with its claws, its pincers digging deep into the feathers and skin, a determined and serious expression on its beady eyes. They are flying over a vast forest, the wind whipping around them. The sky is a turbulent mix of grey and blue. Feathers are scattering in the wind. The crane&rsquo;s eyes reflect panic. Artistic style: energetic watercolor with bold strokes and dynamic composition." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted5.png" width="1024" height="666">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The crane picked up the crab and flew towards the new pond. But then, he started flying towards the tree!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Mr. Crane!&rdquo; the crab said. &ldquo;The pond is that way! Why are you flying this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; the crane said with a sneer. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m your servant, carrying you around wherever you want? Look at that pile of fish bones under the tree! I ate all those fish, and I&rsquo;m going to eat you too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fish were eaten because they were silly!&rdquo; the crab said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to let you eat me! I&rsquo;m going to get you! You didn&rsquo;t realize I was tricking you. If we die, we die together! I&rsquo;m going to cut off your head!&rdquo; And with that, he squeezed the crane&rsquo;s neck even harder with his claws.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 736;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the crab severing the crane&rsquo;s neck with its sharp claws while mid-flight. The crane&rsquo;s body begins to fall, feathers flying everywhere, its eyes wide with shock and pain. The crab maintains a determined and serious expression, its claws dripping with blood. The background shows a blurred panorama of the forest floor rushing upwards. Artistic style: dramatic watercolor with a focus on movement and emotion. Use of red to highlight the violence." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted6.png" width="1024" height="736">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The crane gasped for air, tears running down his face. He was terrified! &ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to eat you! Please let me live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, alright! Fly down to the pond and put me in the water!&rdquo; the crab said.</p>
<p>The crane quickly flew down to the pond and placed the crab on the muddy edge. As soon as the crab was safe, he snipped the crane&rsquo;s neck with his claws, cutting it clean off, like cutting a flower stem with a knife! Then, he finally crawled into the water.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the tree spirit smiling down at a victorious-looking crab crawling into the lotus pond at dawn. The crab&rsquo;s shell glistens with dew, and its claws are slightly raised in a gesture of triumph. Fish swim safely in the pond behind the crab, their scales shimmering in the sunlight. Sunlight is filtering through the trees, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The water is crystal clear. Artistic style: bright and cheerful watercolor with a focus on capturing the joy and relief of the scene." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted7.png" width="1024" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The tree spirit, who lived in the tree, saw everything. He was so impressed with the crab that he made the whole forest echo with his cheers. In a loud, happy voice, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sneaky bad guy, even if he&rsquo;s smart,
Won&rsquo;t win with his sneaky plan from the start.
He might trick you once, he might trick you twice,
But he&rsquo;ll end up like the crane, paying the price!&rdquo;</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of a pile of fish bones bleached white beneath a large, decaying tree. In the background, a crane&rsquo;s lifeless body is seen plunging toward the ground, its wings twisted and broken. The scene is surrounded by lush greenery, overgrown and wild, and the pond is in the distant background, reflecting the stormy sky. Dark shadows creep across the forest floor. A sense of ominous quiet fills the air. Artistic style: somber and atmospheric watercolor with a muted color palette and focus on decay and consequence." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cruel-crane-outwitted8.png" width="1024" height="795">
