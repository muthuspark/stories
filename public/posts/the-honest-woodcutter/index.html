    <p>Once upon a time, near a big forest, lived a woodcutter.  He chopped down trees and sold the wood in the nearby market to earn money.</p>
<p>One day, while he was chopping, his axe accidentally fell into a fast-flowing river. The river was very deep!</p>
<p>The woodcutter tried and tried to find his axe, but he couldn&rsquo;t reach it. He was very sad and sat down by the river and started to cry.</p>
<p>The river god heard the woodcutter&rsquo;s cries and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woodcutter told him his sad story. The river god felt sorry for the woodcutter and saw how hard he worked and how honest he was. He decided to help!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration showcasing the three axes: a rusty iron axe, a shiny silver axe, and a gleaming golden axe. The woodcutter (brown hair, red shirt, blue trousers) is shown reacting with different expressions to each axe.  The river is represented by soft blues and greens, with a hint of movement.  The background features a section of the forest, with simplified tree shapes in muted greens and browns.  Maintain consistent character design and color palette throughout." src="/posts/images/image_the-honest-woodcutter1.png" width="1024" height="722">

<p>The river god disappeared into the water and then reappeared with a golden axe! But the woodcutter said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The river god disappeared again and came back with a silver axe.  The woodcutter shook his head and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not mine either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The river god went back into the water one more time. This time, he came back with an iron axe.  The woodcutter&rsquo;s face lit up!  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my axe!&rdquo; he cried happily.</p>
<p>The river god was so impressed by the woodcutter&rsquo;s honesty that he gave him the golden axe and the silver axe as gifts, too!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a woodcutter, consistently depicted with brown hair, a red shirt, and blue trousers, sitting by a rushing river. The river is a vibrant teal, and the forest background is a mix of deep greens and browns. A river god, depicted with flowing light blue robes and long white hair, is partially submerged in the water, offering a golden axe to the woodcutter. In the background, a pile of cut logs is visible.  The style should be whimsical and slightly cartoonish, maintaining consistency in character design across the scene." src="/posts/images/image_the-honest-woodcutter0.png" width="1024" height="535">
