        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor painting showcasing a moment of unexpected intimacy. Kamatura, an old merchant with pale skin and grey hair, wearing a luxurious robe in deep purples and golds, is embraced by his young wife, her dark hair framing her face, clad in a bright pink garment.  A shadowy figure of a thief is partially visible in the background, suggesting a sense of danger that has unexpectedly brought the couple closer. The style should feel soft and intimate, using cool blues and warm pinks as dominant colors." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-old-man-young-wife-and-thief2.png" width="1024" height="654">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a rich, old merchant named Kamatura.  He was very sad because his wife had died, and he wanted to get married again.</p>
<p>He gave a lot of money to another merchant to marry his young daughter.  But the young wife wasn&rsquo;t happy! She didn&rsquo;t like her old husband at all. She wouldn&rsquo;t even look at him.</p>
<p>The old merchant was sad, but he tried very hard to make his wife happy.</p>
<p>One night, a thief snuck into their house! The young wife woke up and heard the thief. She was scared!  She quickly hugged her husband really tight to feel safe, without making a sound.</p>
<p>The old merchant woke up feeling his wife&rsquo;s hug. He was surprised! He thought, &ldquo;Wow, she&rsquo;s hugging me! Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he saw the thief! He understood. His wife had hugged him because she was scared.</p>
<p>He shouted to the thief, &ldquo;Thank you! My wife never hugs me, but now she does because of you!  Please take whatever you want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old merchant was very happy. Sometimes, even something bad can lead to something good!</p>
