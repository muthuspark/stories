    <p>Once upon a time, in a small village, a farmer and his wife lived together.  The farmer loved to buy hens from the market and take care of them.</p>
<p>One day, he brought home a new hen. He loved and cared for her, and she grew healthy and strong.</p>
<p>After a few months, the hen laid an egg! But this wasn&rsquo;t just any egg – it was a golden egg!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a farmer and his wife, both wearing simple, earthy-toned clothing (the farmer in browns and the wife in a muted blue), standing beside a hen house. The hen is depicted as a plump, healthy Rhode Island Red with vibrant red feathers.  In the foreground, a single gleaming golden egg rests on the ground, contrasted by the muted earth tones of the setting.  In the background, faintly, is a suggestion of their small village. Use a soft, warm color palette with muted greens, browns, and yellows, emphasizing the contrast of the golden egg against the rustic setting. The style should be reminiscent of classic children&rsquo;s book illustrations." src="/posts/images/image_the-hen-that-laid-golden-eggs0.png" width="1024" height="863">

<p>The farmer and his wife were amazed!  The hen laid a golden egg every day, and they sold them for lots of money.  But then, greed crept into their hearts.</p>
<p>The farmer thought, &lsquo;If she lays one golden egg every day, how many more must be inside her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came up with a terrible plan. He killed the hen and cut it open, hoping to find many more golden eggs. But guess what?  There were no more eggs inside!</p>
<p>The farmer and his wife were very, very sorry. They had killed their hen and lost all their golden eggs. They learned a valuable lesson that day.</p>

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 723;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration of a heartbroken farmer and wife, their clothes now slightly more disheveled and dull in color than before (same color scheme as above), kneeling beside a lifeless hen, its feathers slightly ruffled and looking dull.  Blood is subtly suggested, depicted with dark reddish-brown washes, rather than intensely realistic detail.  The scene is somber and slightly muted in color. A scattering of brown feathers and the absence of a golden egg emphasizes their loss. The background shows a slightly darker, more somber representation of the village. Focus on conveying emotion through color and composition." src="/posts/images/image_the-hen-that-laid-golden-eggs1.png" width="1024" height="723">

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Greed is bad.  It&rsquo;s always better to be happy with what you have.</p>
