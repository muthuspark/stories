    <p>Once upon a time, there were two super strong wrestlers! One was even stronger than the other, and he had a daughter named Ajit. The other wrestler didn&rsquo;t have any kids. They didn&rsquo;t live in the same town, but their towns were pretty close.</p>
<p>One day, the wrestler without a daughter heard about the wrestler with the daughter. He decided he wanted to wrestle him to see who was the strongest! So, he went to Ajit&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s town. When he got to their house, he knocked and said, &ldquo;Hello? Is anyone home?&rdquo; Ajit answered, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; and she came outside. The wrestler asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wrestler who lives here?&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;My dad took three hundred carts to the forest to get wood. He&rsquo;s pulling them himself because he couldn&rsquo;t find enough horses or cows to help!&rdquo; The wrestler was super surprised. He said, &ldquo;Wow, your dad must be REALLY strong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 680;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Ajit&rsquo;s father, a very large, strong wrestler with a weathered face and bulging muscles, pulling three hundred heavily laden carts through a lush, sun-dappled forest. The trees are vibrant green with dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, contrasting with the dark, worn wooden carts and the hard work etched on his face. His brow is furrowed with effort. Roots are visible on the forest floor. The carts are filled with various goods, including pottery, textiles, and grain. The color palette is dominated by greens and browns, with pops of color from the goods on the carts. Focus on wet-on-wet watercolor techniques to create a sense of depth and atmosphere. Time of day: late afternoon, long shadows." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-a-wonderful-story1.png" width="1024" height="680">
    </div>

</p>
<p>Then, he went to the forest. He saw two dead elephants! He tied them to a long stick, put the stick on his shoulder, and went back to Ajit&rsquo;s house. He knocked and shouted, &ldquo;Hello? Is anyone here?&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; He asked, &ldquo;Is your dad back yet?&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; She was busy sweeping the floor. Her dad had twelve elephants. Eleven were in the barn, but one was dead in the room Ajit was cleaning. She just swept the dead elephant right out the door like it was nothing! The wrestler got scared. He thought, &ldquo;Wow, this girl is strong!&rdquo; After Ajit swept everything up, she picked up the dust and the dead elephant and threw it all away! The wrestler was even more amazed.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 743;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration, bathed in warm morning light, of Ajit, a young woman with a strong build and determined expression, sweeping a dead elephant out the door of her simple mud-brick home with a worn straw broom. Dust motes dance in the sunbeams streaming through the doorway. The wooden floor is uneven and worn. The visiting wrestler, a muscular man with a wide-eyed, surprised expression and sweat glistening on his brow, stands nearby, clutching his wrestling belt, watching in disbelief. A few chickens peck around the yard outside. Soft shadows fall across the scene, emphasizing the depth of the doorway. The color palette is earthy tones of browns, greens, and yellows, creating a rustic, humble atmosphere. Focus on soft blending and natural watercolor flow." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-a-wonderful-story0.png" width="1024" height="743">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>He went to find Ajit&rsquo;s dad again and saw him pulling the three hundred carts! He was even more scared, but he said, &ldquo;Will you wrestle me now?&rdquo; Ajit&rsquo;s dad said, &ldquo;No, because there&rsquo;s no one here to watch!&rdquo; The wrestler begged him again, and just then, an old lady walked by. She was bringing bread to her son, who was taking care of her three or four thousand camels!</p>
<p>The wrestler called to her, &ldquo;Hey, come watch us wrestle!&rdquo; The old lady said, &ldquo;No, I need to bring my son his lunch. He&rsquo;s very hungry!&rdquo; The wrestlers said, &ldquo;No, please stay and watch!&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay, but one of you can stand on one of my hands, and the other can stand on the other. Then you can wrestle while we walk!&rdquo; The wrestlers said, &ldquo;Carry us?! You&rsquo;re so old, you can&rsquo;t carry us!&rdquo; The old lady said, &ldquo;Yes, I can!&rdquo; So, they stood on her hands, and she put her hands on her shoulders. She put her son&rsquo;s bread on her head. Then, they started walking, and the wrestlers wrestled while they moved!</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 762; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the old woman, her face etched with wrinkles and a serene smile, walking steadily. Two wrestlers, one with a red dhoti and the other with a blue one, are actively wrestling on her shoulders, balanced on her strong hands. They are caught mid-action, straining against each other. The old woman balances a large, intricately woven basket filled with ripe fruit on her head. The basket is secured with a worn piece of cloth. Dust kicks up around her bare feet. The scene is bathed in the golden light of the setting sun. The background features rolling hills and a distant village. The color palette emphasizes warm tones with touches of bright red and blue. Watercolor style should be loose and expressive, capturing the movement and energy of the wrestlers." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-a-wonderful-story2.png" width="762" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The old lady had told her son that if he didn&rsquo;t do his job well, she would bring men to hurt him. So, he got really scared when he saw his mom coming with the wrestlers. He thought, &ldquo;Oh no, my mom is coming to hurt me!&rdquo; He tied up all three or four thousand camels in his blanket, put them on his head, and ran away as fast as he could! &ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; his mother shouted. But he just ran faster. So, the old lady and the wrestlers chased after him.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 825; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the old woman&rsquo;s son, a young man with wide eyes and a panicked expression, running away at full speed. He has a very large, haphazardly tied bundle of colorful carpets and blankets balanced precariously on his head. A large, predatory kite with sharp talons is swooping down menacingly to grab the bundle, its shadow falling across his face. The background is a dry, arid landscape with thorny bushes and a cracked, dusty earth. The color palette is muted browns, oranges, and yellows, reflecting the harsh environment. The wind whips at his clothes, adding to the sense of urgency. The watercolor technique should be slightly looser and more textured to convey the frantic energy." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-a-wonderful-story3.png" width="825" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>A kite was flying in the sky, and it thought, &ldquo;There must be food in that man&rsquo;s blanket!&rdquo; So, it flew down and grabbed the bundle of camels! The old lady&rsquo;s son sat down and cried.</p>
<p>The wrestlers caught up to him and asked, &ldquo;Why are you crying?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Oh, my mom said she would bring men to hurt me if I didn&rsquo;t do my job. So, when I saw you coming with her, I tied all the camels in my blanket, put them on my head, and ran away. Then a kite came and took them all! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m crying!&rdquo; The wrestlers were surprised by how strong the boy was and how strong the kite was. They all went in the direction the kite flew.</p>
<p>The kite flew to another country. The princess of that country was sitting on the roof of her palace, brushing her long hair. She looked up at the kite and the bundle and said, &ldquo;There must be food in that bundle!&rdquo; Just then, the kite dropped the camels, and they fell right into the princess&rsquo;s eye! But her eye was so big that it didn&rsquo;t hurt her much. &ldquo;Oh, Mom! Mom!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Something fell into my eye! Come take it out!&rdquo; Her mom ran up, took the bundle of camels out of her eye, and put it in her pocket.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 711; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of the princess, adorned in jewels and a flowing silk robe, sitting on the ornate, tile-covered roof of her palace. She is brushing her long, black, flowing hair with a jeweled comb. The roof overlooks a bustling city with intricate architecture. The time is twilight, with a soft purple and orange sky. A bundle of unruly camels, tied together with rope, is comically falling from the sky towards her face, their legs flailing. Some of the rope is frayed. The color palette is rich and vibrant, with deep blues, purples, and golds. The style should be highly detailed and elegant, emphasizing the princess&rsquo;s beauty and the opulence of her surroundings." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-a-wonderful-story4.png" width="711" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The wrestlers and the old woman&rsquo;s son arrived. They asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the bundle of camels? And why are you crying?&rdquo; The princess&rsquo;s mom said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s crying because something fell into her eye.&rdquo; The old woman&rsquo;s son said to the queen, &ldquo;It was the bundle of camels that fell into her eye, and it&rsquo;s in your pocket!&rdquo; He reached into her pocket and took out the bundle. Then, he and the wrestlers went back to Ajit&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s house. They met his old mother on the way, and she joined them.</p>
<p>They invited lots of people for dinner. Ajit made a huge pile of flatbread. She gave a big piece to the wrestler who came to visit her dad and gave one to everyone else. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat such a big piece!&rdquo; said the wrestler. Ajit asked, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No way, it&rsquo;s too big!&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll eat it!&rdquo; She grabbed it and all the other pieces and popped them all in her mouth! &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not even enough for me!&rdquo; she said. Then she offered him a can of water. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t drink all that water!&rdquo; he said. Ajit asked, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you? I can drink way more than that!&rdquo; She filled a big tub with water, lifted it up, and drank it all in one gulp!</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 723;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Ajit, in a simple, worn cotton dress, casually drinking an entire terracotta tub of water in one single, impressive gulp. Water spills down her chin and neck. The visiting wrestler, a muscular man with a comical expression of astonished disbelief, stands nearby, his jaw dropped. The scene takes place in a simple courtyard with a well and a few potted plants. The walls are whitewashed and slightly cracked. The light is bright and direct, casting sharp shadows. The color palette is warm and inviting, with blues, greens, and terracotta tones. The watercolor technique should be loose and expressive, capturing the humorous scene." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-a-wonderful-story5.png" width="1024" height="723">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The wrestler was really surprised. He said to her, &ldquo;Will you come to my house? I&rsquo;ll make you dinner!&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be able to give me enough to eat and drink!&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes, I will!&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, I can&rsquo;t come.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Please come!&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll come, but I know you won&rsquo;t be able to feed me enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, they went to his house. After walking for a little bit, she said, &ldquo;I need to bring my house with me!&rdquo; The wrestler said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t carry your house!&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;You have to, or I can&rsquo;t come with you!&rdquo; The wrestler said, &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t carry your house!&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll carry it myself!&rdquo; She went back, dug up her house, and put it on her head! The wrestler was scared. He thought, &ldquo;She must be incredibly strong! I don&rsquo;t want to wrestle her dad because he&rsquo;ll hurt me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 776; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration of Ajit, with a small but sturdy house balanced perfectly on her head, walking confidently down a dusty path. The house is simple but charming, with a thatched roof and small windows. Smoke curls from the chimney. The visiting wrestler, looking intimidated and slightly pale, walks slightly ahead of her, glancing back nervously. A field of golden wheat stretches out in the background, shimmering in the afternoon sun. The color palette is warm and earthy, with golds, browns, and greens. The watercolor technique should emphasize the texture of the thatched roof, the dusty path, and the shimmering wheat field. Light creates a strong contrast, emphasizing the house on Ajit&rsquo;s head." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-a-wonderful-story6.png" width="776" height="1024">
    </div>

</p>
<p>They kept walking until they got to his house. Ajit put her house down, and the wrestler went to get the dinner he promised. He brought tons of food – everything he could think of! Three types of flour, milk, dhall, rice, curries, and meat. Then he showed it all to Ajit. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not enough for my dinner!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t even be enough for my mice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wrestler was very confused. He asked, &ldquo;Are your mice really big?&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re huge! Come see!&rdquo; He took all the food he brought and put it on the floor of Ajit&rsquo;s house. Then, all the mice came and ate every single bit! The wrestler was shocked. Ajit said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? I told you that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to give me enough to eat!&rdquo; The wrestler said, &ldquo;Come to the Nabha Raja&rsquo;s country. You&rsquo;ll definitely get enough to eat there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She agreed. So, she, her father, and the wrestler went to the Nabha Raja&rsquo;s country. The wrestler told the Raja, &ldquo;I brought a very strong girl!&rdquo; The Raja said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll test her strength. Ajit, give me three elephants, and I&rsquo;ll carry them for you.&rdquo; The Raja sent for three elephants and told her, &ldquo;Carry these!&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;Give me a rope!&rdquo; They gave her a rope, and she tied the three elephants together and threw them over her shoulder. She asked the Raja, &ldquo;Now, where should I throw them? Should I throw them on the roof of your palace, on the ground, or far away?&rdquo; The Raja said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! Throw them on my roof!&rdquo; She threw the elephants on the roof with so much force that it broke, and the elephants fell through into the palace!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?!&rdquo; shouted the Raja. Ajit said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault! You told me to throw the elephants on your roof, so I did!&rdquo; The Raja called lots of men, cows, and horses to pull the elephants out of his palace. They couldn&rsquo;t do it the first time, but they tried again and succeeded. Then, they threw the elephants away.</p>
<p>Ajit went home. The Nabha Raja said, &ldquo;What am I going to do about that crazy woman? She&rsquo;ll probably hurt me and take my country! I&rsquo;ll try to hurt her!&rdquo; So, he got his soldiers and guns ready and went to hurt Ajit. She was looking out her window and saw them coming. &ldquo;Oh no, the Nabha Raja is coming to hurt me!&rdquo; she said. She went outside and asked him why he came. The Raja said, &ldquo;To hurt you!&rdquo; She asked, &ldquo;Is that what you want?&rdquo; With one hand, she picked up the Raja, his guns, and his soldiers and put them all under her arm! She carried them all to the Nabha Raja&rsquo;s country. She put the Raja in jail and made herself the queen of his kingdom! She was super happy to be the queen because it was a rich country with lots of fruits and corn. She lived happily for a long, long time!</p>
