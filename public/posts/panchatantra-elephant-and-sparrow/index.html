        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a jungle scene. A sad mama sparrow, depicted in muted browns and grays, sits near a broken nest with cracked eggs.  A large, grumpy elephant, rendered in deep gray and brown, is partially submerged in a muddy hole. A bright red woodpecker, a buzzing blue fly, and a green frog with large, wise eyes are gathered near the sparrow, looking at her with concern. The overall mood is one of sadness turning to hope. The background is a lush watercolor wash of greens and browns, suggesting a jungle environment.  The scale of the characters is consistent, with the elephant significantly larger than the other animals, which are similar in size to each other." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-elephant-and-sparrow0.png" width="1024" height="721">

<p>Two little sparrows lived in a cozy nest high up in a big jungle tree.  Mama sparrow was waiting for her babies to hatch from her eggs.</p>
<p>One hot day, a grumpy elephant got very, very angry! He stomped through the jungle, crashing into trees.  Crash!  Bam!  The elephant broke the branch holding the sparrows&rsquo; nest!</p>
<p>The nest fell, and sadly, all the eggs broke. The mama sparrow was so sad and cried.  She missed her babies so much.</p>
<p>A woodpecker saw the mama sparrow crying.  He said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, little sparrow.  Let&rsquo;s try to help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mama sparrow said, &ldquo;The elephant broke my eggs!  Can you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woodpecker said, &ldquo;I have a friend, a fly! Let&rsquo;s ask her for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woodpecker and the sparrow flew to see the fly.  The fly said, &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll help! I have a friend, a frog. Let&rsquo;s get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all went to see the wise old frog.  The frog listened to their story and smiled.  &ldquo;I have a plan!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The frog said, &ldquo;Fly, you buzz in the elephant&rsquo;s ears when it&rsquo;s sunny. Woodpecker, when the elephant closes his eyes, peck his eyes! Then, the elephant will be blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hide by a muddy hole,&rdquo; said the frog.  &ldquo;When the blind elephant hears my croaking, he&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s water and fall in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all followed the plan. The fly buzzed, the woodpecker pecked, and the frog croaked.  The elephant fell into the muddy hole!</p>
<p>Even though they were small, the fly, woodpecker, and frog helped the sparrow. They showed that even small friends can be super strong when they work together!</p>
