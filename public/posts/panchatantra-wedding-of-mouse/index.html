<p>Once upon a time, near a big river, lived some wise people called hermits.  They lived with their teacher, a very special Guru named Yadnyavalkya.  He was always quiet and thinking deeply.</p>
<p>One day, while the Guru was taking a bath, a hawk dropped a tiny mouse right into his hands!  The Guru knew the mouse needed help, so he gently put it on a big leaf. Then he took another bath to be clean.</p>
<p>Using his magic, the Guru changed the mouse into a little girl! He and his wife decided to take care of her like their own daughter. The little girl learned many things and grew up happy.</p>
<p>When she grew up, it was time to find her a husband.  The Guru, using his magic, asked the Sun to marry her. But the girl said, &ldquo;The Sun is too hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, he asked the King of the Clouds. But she said, &ldquo;The clouds are too wet and cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he asked the Lord of the Winds.  But she said, &ldquo;The wind is too fast and always changing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He even asked the Lord of the Mountains.  But she said, &ldquo;The mountains are too hard and still!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, the mountains suggested the King of the Mice.  The girl was very happy to marry him!  The Guru used his magic to change her back into a mouse, so she could live with her new husband.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the wise Guru&rsquo;s daughter found her perfect match!  It just goes to show, you can&rsquo;t change who you really are!</p>
