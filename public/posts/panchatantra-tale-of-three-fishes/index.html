Use a consistent light orange color for Ana and Prat and a consistent dark blue for Yadbhav.

In contrast, Yadbhav is smaller and less detailed, appearing forlorn among other dark blue fish in the far background of a muddy pond, partially obscured by a fishing net.

<p>Three little fish, Ana, Prat, and Yadbhav, lived in a pond with lots of other fish.</p>
<p>One day, some fishermen came by.  They saw the pond was full of yummy fish!  They decided to come back in the morning.</p>
<p>Ana and Prat heard the fishermen talking.  They were scared! &ldquo;The fishermen are coming back!&rdquo; cried Ana. &ldquo;We need to leave!&rdquo;  Prat agreed, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to a new pond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yadbhav laughed.  &ldquo;Silly fish!&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;This is our home! We&rsquo;ve always lived here, and nothing bad has ever happened.  Let&rsquo;s stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some fish followed Ana and Prat to a new pond. Others stayed with Yadbhav.</p>
<p>The next morning, the fishermen came back. They threw their nets into the pond and caught all the fish that were still there!  Poor Yadbhav and his friends!</p>
<p>Ana and Prat were safe in their new home.</p>
<p>The story reminds us:  If you see danger, it&rsquo;s good to get ready to be safe!</p>
