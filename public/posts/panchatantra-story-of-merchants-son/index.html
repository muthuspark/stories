        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting a joyous celebration. The central focus is a man in earthy tones, holding a small, antique book. Three women, a princess in vibrant pink, a bride in soft white, and another woman in calming blue, surround him, all smiling.  A majestic king is present, observing the scene with a gentle smile.  A faded image of a running elephant is subtly visible in the background. Use light washes and soft blends of watercolor, creating a feeling of warmth and happiness. Character design should be consistent across the painting, and their colors should remain consistent." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-story-of-merchants-son1.png" width="1024" height="724">

<p>A long time ago, a merchant had a son.  One day, the son bought a very expensive book!  But the book only had ONE sentence inside:  &ldquo;You get what is destined for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dad was SO angry!  &ldquo;You wasted all that money on one sentence?  Leave my house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son was sad. He left home with only his book.  He traveled and traveled, always saying, &ldquo;You get what is destined for you.&rdquo;  People started calling him &ldquo;You-get-what-is-destined-for-you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One day, a princess saw him at a party.  She liked him, and by mistake, her helper gave him a secret note meant for the prince! The note said, &ldquo;I love you! Meet me at my castle window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son thought, &ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;  He climbed up the rope to the princess&rsquo;s room.  It was dark! The princess thought he was the prince, and they ate and talked. Then she turned on the light and saw it wasn&rsquo;t the prince!  She was mad and sent him away.</p>
<p>He was sad again, so he slept in a temple.  The temple&rsquo;s night watchman asked him to sleep at his house.  But the son went to the wrong room!  The watchman&rsquo;s daughter thought he was her boyfriend and they accidentally got married!</p>
<p>The daughter said, &ldquo;Oops!  That was a mistake!&rdquo; and sent him away.</p>
<p>Later, he saw a wedding.  Suddenly, a scary elephant ran at everyone!  The son was brave! He saved the bride!  The bride said, &ldquo;I will marry HIM!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone argued. The King came! He asked the son to explain everything. The son just said, &ldquo;You get what is destined for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess and the watchman&rsquo;s daughter felt embarrassed because of their mistakes.  The King heard everything. The watchman&rsquo;s daughter said, &ldquo;It was my destiny, and I don&rsquo;t regret it!&rdquo; The princess said the same. So did the bride!</p>
<p>The King was happy! He gave the son many villages and made him rich! He married the son to the princess AND the bride AND the watchman&rsquo;s daughter! They all lived happily ever after! The end!</p>
