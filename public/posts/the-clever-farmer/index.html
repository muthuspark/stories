A small boat is in the foreground, suggesting the successful completion of a problem.  The grass is depicted in a bright, realistic style, contrasting with the more whimsical style of the animals and farmer. A sense of relief and accomplishment should be conveyed in the farmer&rsquo;s expression.  Use a range of watercolor washes to create depth and texture; employ a vibrant color palette while maintaining a consistent style for characters throughout the painting. Style: Slightly whimsical, reminiscent of children&rsquo;s book illustrations." src="/posts/images/image_the-clever-farmer2.png" width="1024" height="624">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a farmer. He had a goat, a pile of grass, and a lion. He needed to take them all across a river in a tiny boat!  The boat was so small, he could only take one thing at a time.</p>
<p>If he took the lion first, the goat would eat all the grass!  If he took the grass first, the lion would eat the goat!</p>
<p>The farmer was so worried, he sat down on the ground feeling sad.</p>
<p>But then, he had a clever idea! First, he took the goat across the river and left it there.</p>
<p>Next, he went back and took the lion across. But he brought the goat back to the first side so the lion wouldn&rsquo;t eat it!</p>
<p>Then, he took the grass across to the lion.  He went back alone in the boat.</p>
<p>Finally, he went back and got the goat!</p>
<p>He got everyone across the river safely!</p>
<p>The farmer was so clever! He showed that with patience and smart thinking, even hard problems can be solved.</p>
