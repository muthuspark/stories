    <p>Once upon a time, in a little river, lived three colorful fish.  There was a red fish, a blue fish, and a yellow fish. They were the best of friends and always swam together.</p>
<p>One day, the blue fish was swimming near the riverbank and overheard some fishermen talking.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to fish in this river!&rdquo; one fisherman said. &ldquo;Lots of yummy fish swim here! Let&rsquo;s go fishing tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration:  Three friendly fish – a bright red, a tranquil blue, and a cheerful yellow – swimming in a clear river.  The red fish is larger and depicted being pulled slightly upwards by an unseen fishing net, its expression worried. The blue and yellow fish are smaller, watching with concerned expressions from behind some partially submerged river plants. The water is a translucent blue-green, and the riverbank is subtly suggested with soft greens and browns. Use a light, airy watercolor style." src="/posts/images/image_the-three-little-fish1.png" width="1024" height="721">

<p>The blue fish was worried. She quickly swam to her friends and said, &ldquo;Listen! I heard the fishermen. They plan to fish in our river tomorrow! We need to be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red fish said, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s okay! They won&rsquo;t catch me. I&rsquo;m too fast! Besides, we have all the food we need right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue fish said, &ldquo;But we should go somewhere safe, just for one day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yellow fish agreed with the blue fish.  &ldquo;I think we should be careful, even if this is our home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue and yellow fish tried to convince the red fish, but he didn&rsquo;t listen. He was too proud.</p>
<p>The next morning, the fishermen cast their nets and caught many fish – green ones, orange ones, white ones, even some rainbow-colored fish! And guess what? They caught the red fish, too!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great catch!&rdquo; the fishermen cheered.  They hadn&rsquo;t caught so many fish in a long time.</p>
<p>From a safe distance, the blue and yellow fish sadly watched. They were very sorry that their friend, the red fish, had been caught.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of three cartoon fish: a round red fish, a slightly smaller round blue fish, and a similarly sized round yellow fish.  The red fish is depicted being caught in a net, with the net&rsquo;s brown and beige ropes visible. The blue and yellow fish watch sadly from a distance amongst vibrant green water plants. The background shows a calm river scene with soft, muted greens and blues, and a suggestion of a distant bank where two stick-figure fishermen stand. The style should be reminiscent of a children&rsquo;s storybook illustration." src="/posts/images/image_the-three-little-fish00.png" width="1024" height="610">

<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> We should listen to our friends&rsquo; good advice and not be too proud.</p>
