        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a story: A wealthy man, depicted in shades of deep brown and gold, with a slightly plump figure and a stern expression, is embracing his daughter, a small girl with bright pink dress and rosy cheeks, who is now turning golden.  In the background, a whimsical fairy with shimmering teal hair and gown, is partially obscured behind a gnarled, golden tree, her expression a mix of sadness and pity. The overall color palette is warm, with golds and browns contrasting against the cool teal of the fairy and the pink of the girl&rsquo;s dress. Focus on the emotional contrast between the man&rsquo;s greedy expression and the girl’s innocent, now golden, form.  Use loose, expressive watercolor brushstrokes to capture the emotional weight of the scene." src="/posts/images/image_the-greedy-man0.png" width="1024" height="712">

<p>Once upon a time, in a small town, lived a very rich, greedy man.  He loved gold and jewels more than anything! But, he loved his daughter more than anything else.</p>
<p>One day, he saw a fairy!  Her hair was caught in the branches of a tree. The kind man helped her free her hair.  But then, his greed took over. He thought, &lsquo;I should ask the fairy for a wish! I can get even richer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He asked the fairy for a wish, and she granted it. The greedy man said, &lsquo;I wish that everything I touch turns to gold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fairy made it so.  The man was so happy! He touched rocks and pebbles, and they turned into gold! He ran home to tell his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>When he got home, his daughter ran to hug him.  He bent down to hug her back, but… oh no!  She turned into a golden statue!  He realized his terrible mistake.</p>
<p>

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 721;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting: A close-up on the moment the man&rsquo;s daughter transforms.  The man&rsquo;s hand is touching her cheek, the gold spreading like a wildfire across her pink dress and skin.  His face is a mask of horror and regret, painted in dark browns and muted oranges.  His daughter&rsquo;s face, though turning gold, retains a hint of her rosy cheeks, creating a poignant contrast. The background is blurred, hinting at a lush green landscape and a distant, almost ethereal, fairy with shimmering teal hair. Focus on the texture of the watercolor, showing the smoothness of the gold against the rougher texture of the man&rsquo;s clothing and the girl&rsquo;s original skin tone. Use vibrant colors for the initial rosy skin tone and then muted gold for the transforming body." src="/posts/images/image_the-greedy-man2.png" width="1024" height="721">

<p>He cried and cried, trying to find the fairy to undo his wish, but he couldn&rsquo;t. He learned a very important lesson: too much greed can lead to sadness and loss.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
