    <p>Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had five sons.  But his sons always fought with each other! They weren&rsquo;t very good at getting along.</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a heartwarming family scene. Five similar-sized, slightly chubby sons, all wearing simple brown shirts and pants, are clustered around their elderly father, who is holding a large bundle of thin, light brown sticks. The father is depicted with soft, warm colors and kind eyes. The sons&rsquo; faces show a mixture of surprise and understanding.  The background should be a soft, muted palette of greens and yellows suggesting a peaceful farm setting. Focus on depicting the unity of the family; the sticks should be clearly visible and tied together tightly. Use a loose, expressive watercolor style with visible brushstrokes to add to the rustic feel." src="/posts/images/image_the-power-of-unity0.png" width="1024" height="680">

<p>When the farmer was very old and knew he was going to die, he called his five sons together. He gave them a big bundle of thin sticks.  He said, &ldquo;Try to break this bundle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The five sons tried their best, but none of them could break the bundle of sticks.</p>
<p>Then the old farmer said, &ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s try something different. Untie the bundle, and each of you break one stick.&rdquo;  The sons did this, and each stick broke easily!</p>
<p>The five sons were very surprised. They asked their father why he did this.  He explained, &ldquo;See? When the sticks are together in a bundle, they are strong.  No one could break them. But when they are separated, they are weak and easy to break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is like you,&rdquo; the farmer said. &ldquo;If you all stay together and are united, nobody can defeat you, and you will all be happy. But if you fight and separate, you will become weak like the single sticks and easily broken. So promise me, you&rsquo;ll always stay together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s sons learned their lesson. After that, they never fought again and lived happily together. The farmer also lived happily, knowing his sons were finally getting along.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting depicting the five sons (consistent attire in muted orange tones) standing shoulder to shoulder, smiling and holding hands in a circle around their father&rsquo;s grave (a simple, slightly raised mound with gentle green grass). The background features a soft, pale blue sky and a few simple trees. A single, loose bundle of thin, light brown sticks sits near the grave, symbolizing the strength they&rsquo;ve found in unity. Use a calm, gentle color palette and soft, almost blurry watercolor techniques to give a peaceful and nostalgic feel, emphasizing the lasting lesson of unity." src="/posts/images/image_the-power-of-unity2.png" width="1024" height="680">
