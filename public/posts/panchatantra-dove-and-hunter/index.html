A mean-looking hunter (dark, earthy tones) is shown under the tree, shivering, next to a cage containing a dove (soft pink). Another dove (same pink, similar shape) is approaching the hunter, offering burning leaves.  The background shows a stormy sky with rain. The doves have gentle, compassionate expressions, while the hunter shows remorse.

<p>A mean hunter lived in the jungle. He was so mean that everyone left him.  He hunted birds and other small animals.</p>
<p>In the same jungle, two doves lived happily in a nest high in a big tree.</p>
<p>One day, the hunter caught the mama dove! He put her in a cage.  Then, a big storm came!  The hunter was scared and needed a place to hide.</p>
<p>He found the big tree where the doves lived!  He hid under it to get out of the rain and wind.  He was cold and hungry.</p>
<p>The papa dove was worried because his wife wasn&rsquo;t home.  The storm made him even more worried.</p>
<p>The mama dove called to her husband from her cage.  She told him, &ldquo;The hunter is under our tree. Be kind to him, even though he caught me.  It&rsquo;s important to help others who need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The papa dove was kind and good. He flew down and greeted the hunter warmly, &ldquo;Welcome! Please stay here as long as you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunter was cold and the papa dove brought him some burning leaves to keep warm. But the hunter was still hungry.  The papa dove said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you, please eat me!&rdquo;  He flew into the fire to help the hunter.</p>
<p>The hunter felt very sorry. He was sad for what he did and for the kind dove who helped him. He let the mama dove out of the cage.</p>
<p>Mama dove was so sad that her husband was gone. She flew into the fire too.</p>
<p>In heaven, they became beautiful, shining creatures!  The hunter became a good person and helped others. He was happy in the end.</p>
<p>This story shows us that kindness and helping others are very important.</p>
