<p>Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived three little pigs. Their mother was no longer with them.  The three brothers lived together in a small space.</p>
<p>As they grew bigger, their little home became too small.  So, each of the three little pigs decided to build their own house.</p>
<p>The first pig didn&rsquo;t work very hard and built his house out of straw. The second pig worked a little harder and built his house out of sticks.</p>
<p>The third pig thought carefully and, after working very hard, successfully built a house of bricks.</p>
<p>Now, all three were happily living in their own houses. Some time passed, and one day, a big, bad wolf attacked the three little pigs&rsquo; houses.</p>
<p>The first two little pigs&rsquo; houses (made of straw and sticks) were easily blown down by the wolf&rsquo;s huff and puff! The wolf gobbled up both the little pigs.</p>
<p>After a while, he huffed and puffed again, but he couldn&rsquo;t blow down the third little pig&rsquo;s house. The little pig was safe inside! The wolf tried very hard to break the house, but he couldn&rsquo;t.  The third pig&rsquo;s house was very strong because he had worked so hard to build it.</p>
<p>Soon, the big, bad wolf took a deep breath and ran away.</p>
<p><strong>The Moral of the Story:</strong> Hard work always pays off. Think about the future instead of taking shortcuts, and don&rsquo;t be lazy!</p>
