        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a heartwarming summer scene. Golu, a boy with bright orange shirt and dark hair, is surrounded by five friends, each with distinct clothing colors (one blue, one green, one yellow, one purple, one red) but similar size and simple shapes,  in a vibrant mango orchard. Lush green mango trees laden with ripe yellow mangoes fill the background. In the foreground, Golu is shown twice: once playfully eating a mango alone, and smaller in the next section, where he is helped up by his friends after a fall. Use soft, gentle watercolor washes to depict happiness and care.  Focus on conveying the story&rsquo;s emotional arc from selfishness to sharing." src="/posts/images/image_the-importance-of-friends0.png" width="1024" height="723">

<p>Golu went to his grandmother&rsquo;s house during the summer holidays. He had a lot of fun because his grandmother had a mango orchard! Golu ate lots and lots of mangoes and played all day. He had five friends, but he didn&rsquo;t share his mangoes with them.</p>
<p>One day, while playing, Golu hurt himself. His friends helped him up and took him home. They told Golu&rsquo;s mom what happened. Golu&rsquo;s mom put medicine on his boo-boo and gave him a massage.</p>
<p>She thanked his friends and gave them lots of yummy mangoes to eat.  When Golu got better, he understood how important his friends were.  From then on, he played with them and shared his mangoes happily.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Friends are there for you when you&rsquo;re happy and when you&rsquo;re sad.  We should love our friends and not keep secrets from them.</p>
