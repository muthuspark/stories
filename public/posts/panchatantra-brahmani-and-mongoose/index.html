        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a Brahmin family scene.  The central focus is on the Brahmin mother, in a flowing blue sari, her face etched with grief and regret, looking down at a small, injured mongoose. The mongoose, a rich brown, lies near a dead snake.  The baby, light skinned and safe, is tucked in a basket nearby. The background suggests a simple home interior, emphasizing the intimacy and emotional intensity of the scene. The color palette uses cool blues and greens to convey sadness, contrasting with the warm browns of the mongoose. The style should emphasize the emotional depth through subtle washes of color and soft lines." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-brahmani-and-mongoose2.png" width="1024" height="573">

<p>Once upon a time, a nice Brahmin couple had a baby boy!  On the same day, a mommy mongoose had a baby mongoose nearby. Sadly, the mommy mongoose died.</p>
<p>The Brahmin family felt sorry for the little mongoose and took him in. Mommy Brahmin loved both her baby boy and the little mongoose. She fed them both, bathed them together, and even put oil in their fur! They were best friends and played all the time.</p>
<p>Mommy Brahmin knew the mongoose was a wild animal, though.  She worried he might hurt her son someday.</p>
<p>One day, Mommy Brahmin went to get water. She asked Daddy Brahmin to watch the babies.  But Daddy Brahmin was silly! He went to ask for food, leaving the babies alone.</p>
<p>A scary snake slithered into the house!  The brave little mongoose saw the snake near the baby and fought it! He killed the snake, but he got all bloody in the fight.</p>
<p>When Mommy Brahmin came home, she saw the bloody mongoose.  She thought he hurt her baby and threw a big pot of water at him!  The mongoose was hurt badly.</p>
<p>Mommy Brahmin ran inside.  She found her baby safe and sound!  She saw the dead snake, and she understood everything. She was so, so sad that she hurt her little mongoose friend.</p>
<p>Daddy Brahmin came home, and they were both very sorry. They learned a big lesson that day: Always think carefully before you do something!</p>
