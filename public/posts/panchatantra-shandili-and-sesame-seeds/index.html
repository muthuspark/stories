        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a kind Brahmin and his wife, Shandili, in warm earth tones. Shandili, in a reddish-brown sari, is tending to a small pile of sesame seeds near a sun-drenched house with a terracotta roof. A mischievous-looking dog with dark brown fur is nearby, its tail wagging, near scattered sesame seeds.  The Brahmin, in a similar shade of brown but a slightly lighter dhoti, is depicted walking away from the house towards a distant city visible on the horizon, small and hazy, suggesting his journey to procure food. The overall style should be reminiscent of traditional Indian miniature painting with a soft, watercolor wash." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-shandili-and-sesame-seeds0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, a kind Brahmin and his wife, Shandili, lived near a city. They were happy but didn&rsquo;t have much money.</p>
<p>One day, the Brahmin said, &ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s a special festival!  Let&rsquo;s give some food to a hungry person. I&rsquo;ll go to the city and get some extra food. You should also invite a Brahmin for a meal and give them some clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shandili worried, &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re poor! We don&rsquo;t have extra food or clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brahmin said, &ldquo;Even if we only have a little, we should share it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shandili agreed. &ldquo;I have some sesame seeds,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll clean them and make a tasty dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, the Brahmin went to the city. Shandili cleaned the sesame seeds, dried them in the sun, and did her chores.</p>
<p>A naughty dog came and messed up the sesame seeds!  Shandili was sad.  She thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trick my neighbor! I&rsquo;ll trade my clean sesame seeds for her dirty ones. She&rsquo;ll be happy because cleaning them takes a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shandili went to her neighbor and offered the trade.  The neighbor was excited! But then, her son said, &ldquo;Mom, that&rsquo;s too good to be true! Don&rsquo;t trade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neighbor listened to her son and didn&rsquo;t trade. Shandili went home.</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting focusing on the contrast between Shandili&rsquo;s initial sadness and relief. Shandili, in a reddish-brown sari, is shown in two instances within a single painting; one on the left, with slumped shoulders near the scattered sesame seeds looking dejected, and one on the right, walking back home with her bowl of sesame seeds intact, a hint of relief on her face. The color palette should be warm and earthy, using variations of browns, oranges and yellows, with a muted background suggesting a simple, rural setting. The overall feeling should be one of quiet reflection and learning." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-shandili-and-sesame-seeds2.png" width="1024" height="734">

<p>The story teaches us: When something sounds too good to be true, think carefully before you do it!</p>
