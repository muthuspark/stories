    <p>Once upon a time, a group of frogs was looking for water in the forest.  Suddenly, two frogs accidentally fell into a deep pit!</p>

<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 535;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical forest scene. Two small, bright green frogs, identical in size and shape, are in a deep, dark pit. One frog has a defeated expression and is lying down, while the other frog is mid-jump, eyes determined and mouth open in a silent cheer.  The pit is rendered with deep blues and purples, contrasting sharply with the lush greens of the surrounding forest. Above the pit, a group of larger, paler green frogs are clustered, some with worried expressions, their bodies slightly silhouetted. The overall style is delicate and slightly cartoonish, maintaining consistent frog size, shape, and color throughout the painting." src="/posts/images/image_the-two-frogs00.png" width="1024" height="535">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The other frogs were worried about their friends.  The pit was very deep, and they told the two frogs that there was no way out and that it was useless to try.</p>
<p>They kept discouraging the two frogs as they tried to jump out.  The two frogs tried and tried, but they couldn&rsquo;t get out.</p>
<p>Soon, one of the frogs started to believe the other frogs. He thought he would never escape and sadly, he gave up and died.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 822;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a deep, dark pit, rendered with rich, textured blues and browns. At the bottom, two small, identical vibrant green frogs are depicted. One frog is curled up, painted with duller, less saturated colors, signifying defeat. The other frog is shown mid-jump, dynamic and full of energy; its bright, clear green color contrasts with its defeated counterpart. Above the pit, a group of larger, more muted green frogs are watching; some are faintly painted to show the background chorus of discouragement. Use soft, transparent watercolor washes to create a sense of depth and emotion. Maintain consistency in frog shape, size, and color across the painting.  The style should be evocative and emotionally resonant." src="/posts/images/image_the-two-frogs2.png" width="1024" height="822">
    </div>

</p>
<p>But the other frog kept trying! He jumped and jumped, and finally, he leaped so high that he hopped right out of the pit! The other frogs were amazed. How did he do it?</p>
<p>The difference was, the second frog was deaf! He couldn&rsquo;t hear the other frogs discouraging him. He thought they were cheering him on and encouraging his jumps!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Other people&rsquo;s opinions only affect you if you let them. Believe in yourself and don&rsquo;t let others discourage you!</p>
