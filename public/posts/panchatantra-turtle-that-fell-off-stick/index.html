Kambugriva&rsquo;s mouth is slightly open, suggesting surprise. The background shows a partially dried-up lake bed with cracked earth, contrasting with a lush, vibrant new lake in the distance.

<p>Once upon a time, there was a turtle named Kambugriva who lived in a lake.  She had two swan friends!</p>
<p>Every day, the turtle and the swans would meet by the lake and chat. They loved spending time together.</p>
<p>One day, the lake started to dry up because it didn&rsquo;t rain. The swans were worried.  &ldquo;Kambugriva,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the lake will be all gone! You won&rsquo;t have anywhere to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kambugriva knew they were right.  &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please find another lake with lots of water. And find a strong stick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swans flew far away and found a new lake.  They came back and said, &ldquo;We found it! But Kambugriva, you MUST keep your mouth shut the whole time we carry you.  If you talk, you&rsquo;ll fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swans held the stick, and Kambugriva held onto it with her mouth.  They started to fly!</p>
<p>Soon, they flew over a town.  People pointed and shouted, &ldquo;Look! Swans carrying a turtle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kambugriva was so excited, she opened her mouth to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the fuss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A single watercolor illustration depicting Kambugriva, a small, consistently colored and shaped brown turtle, falling from a stick held in the beaks of two large, consistently sized and shaped white swans. The background features a bustling town with tiny, colorful houses visible below.  The focus is on the moment of Kambugriva&rsquo;s fall, capturing a sense of movement and slight panic. The colors are soft and slightly muted, characteristic of watercolor." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-turtle-that-fell-off-stick1.png" width="689" height="1024">

<p>WHOOSH! She fell down! The people caught her, sadly.</p>
<p>The wise old turtles always say: Listen to your friends! They know what&rsquo;s best.</p>
