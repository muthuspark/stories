<p>Once upon a time, there was a king named King Jabhu, and he had lots and lots of wives! He had seven wives, but sadly, he didn&rsquo;t have any children. Even though he was married to seven wonderful ladies, none of them had given him a baby. This made him super sad, and he said, &ldquo;I have seven wives, but not one child!&rdquo; He got very upset with the world and asked, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I have any kids? I&rsquo;m going to go into the forest and be by myself.&rdquo; The queens tried to make him stay, but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen. He wanted to go into the forest.</p>
<p>So, he went far into the forest, and someone very special came to him – a wise old man with a walking stick! The king met him, and the wise man said, &ldquo;Why are you in the forest? There are tigers here that might eat you! Tell me what you wish for. I can help you!&rdquo; At first, the king didn&rsquo;t want to say anything. But finally, he told the wise man, &ldquo;I have seven wives, but no children. I&rsquo;m so sad that I want to be by myself.&rdquo; The wise man smiled and said, &ldquo;Take this stick. Walk a little bit and you&rsquo;ll find a mango tree with juicy mangoes. Throw the stick at the mangoes to knock them down, and catch them with your other hand. When you have them all, take them home and give one to each of your wives!&rdquo; So the king went and knocked the mangoes off the tree and caught them, just like the wise man told him. Then he looked around for the wise man, but he was gone! He had disappeared into the forest. The king went home and gave the seven mangoes to his wives. But the mangoes were so yummy that six of the wives ate them all up and didn&rsquo;t give any to the youngest wife. She felt very sad, went outside, found a mango seed one of the other wives had thrown away, and ate it. After a while, the six wives who ate the mangoes each had a baby boy! But the wife who ate the seed had a monkey! They called him Prince Monkey. He looked like a monkey, but he was really a boy! He was just covered in monkey fur. His six brothers didn&rsquo;t like him. They went to school every day, but Prince Monkey went underground. The fairies taught him! His mom didn&rsquo;t know this. She thought he was just swinging from trees in the forest. But he was the smartest and best of all the boys!</p>
<p>Now, in a faraway kingdom, a three-month trip away, lived a king named King Jamarsa. He had a beautiful daughter named Princess Jahuran. Her dad wanted her to marry someone very strong, so he had a big, heavy iron ball made. Then, he sent letters to all the kings and princes far and wide, saying that anyone who wanted to marry Princess Jahuran had to throw this heavy ball and hit her! Many kings tried, but no one could even lift the ball! One of these letters came to King Jabhu, and his six older sons decided to go to King Jamarsa&rsquo;s kingdom. Each of them thought they could throw the ball and marry the princess!</p>
<p>Prince Monkey giggled and thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try, too! I know I can do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, the six brothers set off on their long trip, and Prince Monkey followed them. But first, he went into the forest, took off his monkey fur, and suddenly, a beautiful horse and clothes appeared! He put them on, followed his brothers, caught up with them, and gave them sweet flowers. &ldquo;Wow, what a handsome boy!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Who does he belong to? He must be a prince!&rdquo; Then, Prince Monkey rode away quickly, took off his fancy clothes, put them on his horse, and the horse flew into the sky! He put his monkey fur back on and followed his brothers again.</p>
<p>When they got to King Jamarsa&rsquo;s palace, they set up their tents in the big yard. Every evening, the princess stood on her balcony and let down her long, golden hair all around her. The kings who wanted to marry her had to try and hit her with the heavy ball that was on the ground in front of her.</p>
<p>King Jamarsa&rsquo;s house had many floors, and you had to go upstairs to get to Princess Jahuran&rsquo;s room, which led to the balcony.</p>
<p>Prince Monkey&rsquo;s six older brothers got ready to go to the palace and throw the ball. They thought it would be easy! Before they left, they told Prince Monkey to watch the tents and have dinner ready for them when they came back. &ldquo;If dinner isn&rsquo;t ready, we&rsquo;ll be mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they left, Prince Monkey took some gold coins he had and went to a restaurant outside the palace yard. He gave the coins to the owner and asked for a big dinner for his six brothers. Then, he took the dinner to the tents, went into the forest, and took off his monkey fur. Right away, a beautiful horse from the sky and fancy clothes appeared! He put them on, got on his horse, and rode to King Jamarsa&rsquo;s yard. He didn&rsquo;t pay attention to the king, the princess, the ball, or the other kings. He only talked to his brothers and gave them lovely flowers. Everyone looked at him and wondered, &ldquo;Who is he? He&rsquo;s so handsome! Where did he come from? Look at his clothes! We can&rsquo;t find clothes like that here!&rdquo; Princess Jahuran thought to herself, &ldquo;That prince will be my husband, even if he can&rsquo;t lift the ball!&rdquo; After giving his brothers the flowers, Prince Monkey rode back to the forest, took off his clothes, laid them on his horse (which flew back to the sky), put his monkey fur back on, went back to the tents, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>When his brothers came home, they were excitedly talking about the handsome prince. They couldn&rsquo;t talk about anything else while they ate dinner!</p>
<p>Well, every evening for ten days, the same thing happened. Each night, Prince Monkey wore a different fancy outfit. The princess always thought, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man I&rsquo;m going to marry, even if he can&rsquo;t throw the ball!&rdquo; Then, on the eleventh evening, after giving his brothers the flowers, he said to the kings, King Jamarsa, and all the servants, &ldquo;Everyone, stand back! I&rsquo;m going to throw the ball!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; they all shouted. &ldquo;We want to watch!&rdquo; &ldquo;You have to stand far away. You can watch from a distance,&rdquo; said Prince Monkey. &ldquo;The ball might fall back and hurt you!&rdquo; So they all stood around him far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Prince Monkey said to himself, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hit the princess this time. I&rsquo;ll hit the balcony railing!&rdquo; Then, he picked up the ball with one hand like it was nothing and threw it at the railing! Then he quickly rode off to the forest.</p>
<p>The next evening, the same thing happened, but this time he threw the ball into Princess Jahuran&rsquo;s dress!</p>
<p>The next evening, the ball hit one of her feet and hurt her toenail. Princess Jahuran was angry that this handsome prince had thrown the ball three times, hit her twice, and hurt her once, but had never talked to her dad or told anyone who he was. He always rode away quickly, and no one knew where he went! She really liked him and wanted to find out who he was, so she asked for a bow and arrow. She said she would shoot the prince the next time he hit her. She wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him badly; she would just shoot the arrow at him. Well, the next evening, Prince Monkey threw the ball, and it landed on her other foot and hurt her big toenail! When he saw she was hurt, he felt very sorry and asked, &ldquo;Did I hurt you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;very much!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have thrown it so hard if I knew it would hurt you.&rdquo; Then, she shot the arrow and hit him in the leg. Blood came out of the wound, but he still rode hard to the forest. This time, he didn&rsquo;t take off his fancy clothes. He just covered them with his monkey fur, and his horse flew to the sky. He went back to the tents. Then, the princess sent a servant into town and told him to bring back whoever or whatever he heard crying from pain, whether it was a person, a fox, a dog, or an animal. So the servant went around town. The six brothers were asleep, but Prince Monkey couldn&rsquo;t sleep because his leg hurt. He couldn&rsquo;t help but cry! The servant heard him and took him to the princess. The princess said she would marry him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried her father. &ldquo;Marry that monkey? Never! Who has ever heard of marrying a monkey?&rdquo; But even though the king didn&rsquo;t like it, the princess said she would marry the monkey. &ldquo;I like that monkey very much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It makes me happy to marry him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;if it makes you happy, you have to marry him, but who has ever heard of marrying a monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, they got married right away! Prince Monkey wore his monkey fur for the wedding.</p>
<p>That night, when they went to bed, the young prince took off his fur and lay next to Princess Jahuran. When she saw her handsome husband, she was so happy! &ldquo;Why do you wear monkey fur?&rdquo; she asked. He answered, &ldquo;I wear it for protection. My brothers are mean and would hurt me if they knew who I really am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lived happily with King Jamarsa for six months, and the six older brothers still lived there, too. They hated Prince Monkey more and more because he had such a beautiful wife.</p>
<p>One night, Prince Monkey thought of his mother and said to his wife, &ldquo;My mother might be sad. Let&rsquo;s go to my father&rsquo;s kingdom and see her.&rdquo; Princess Jahuran agreed. The next morning, they talked to King Jamarsa, who said they could go.</p>
<p>The six brothers said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go with you! Let&rsquo;s get two big boats, one for you and the princess, and one for us. We&rsquo;ll go by water, not by land!&rdquo; It only took six days to get to King Jabhu&rsquo;s kingdom by water, but it took three months by land. Prince Monkey agreed to everything his brothers said.</p>
<p>Princess Jahuran overheard them planning to throw the monkey into the water and then take her home to their father as the wife of one of them! Because she was smart, she went to her father and asked him to make her six big, fluffy mattresses filled with cotton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with six mattresses?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;I want my bed to be very comfortable on the boat,&rdquo; said his daughter. Her father loved her, so he had the mattresses made. The princess had them taken to her boat.</p>
<p>When everything was ready, they went on board the boats with Prince Monkey&rsquo;s six brothers. The princess had warned her husband about his brothers&rsquo; mean plan and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near your brothers! Don&rsquo;t talk to them! They want to hurt you!&rdquo; On the first day, the six brothers said to the monkey, &ldquo;Please bring us some salt.&rdquo; But the monkey said, &ldquo;No, my wife will bring you some.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the brothers, &ldquo;your wife can&rsquo;t bring us any. She&rsquo;s a princess. You bring us some!&rdquo; So they threw a rope from one boat to the other, and the monkey went on the rope. Then, the brothers untied it, and the monkey fell into the water! The princess cried out, &ldquo;My husband is drowning!&rdquo; And she threw out one of the mattresses. The monkey climbed on it, and it floated back to his boat. The crew pulled him up.</p>
<p>The next day, the six brothers asked Prince Monkey to bring them water, and they put a plank from their boat to his for him to walk on. The prince went with the water, even though his wife told him not to, and his brothers tilted the plank into the water! The prince would have drowned if Princess Jahuran hadn&rsquo;t thrown him a mattress. The same thing happened for the next four days. The brothers wanted something to eat or drink, and their monkey brother brought it to them across a rope or plank, which they cut or dropped into the water. He would have drowned if not for the mattresses his wife threw to him.</p>
<p>When they arrived in King Jabhu&rsquo;s kingdom, the oldest son went to his father&rsquo;s palace. Each of the king&rsquo;s seven wives had their own house. The son went to his mother&rsquo;s house and said, &ldquo;Give me your fancy seat, Mother, because I&rsquo;ve brought home a beautiful wife! I want to bring her to the palace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother was happy about this news, and she told the other queens, &ldquo;My son has brought home a beautiful wife! I&rsquo;m so happy!&rdquo; The youngest queen started to cry. &ldquo;My son is just a monkey,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never get married or have a wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, the fancy seat was ready, and the seven queens and the prince went to the boat. Princess Jahuran came on land with her monkey, and when the queens saw her, they all cried, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so beautiful!&rdquo; The oldest queen was happier than ever, and the youngest cried even more. The princess got into the seat with her monkey. &ldquo;What are you doing with that monkey?&rdquo; said the oldest prince. &ldquo;Get him out of the seat!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my husband, and I love him!&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried all the queens. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re married to that monkey?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;Then get out of my seat!&rdquo; said the oldest queen. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ride in my seat with that monkey!&rdquo; The youngest queen was happy that her son had such a beautiful wife. So the princess got out and took her monkey in her arms and walked with him to the youngest queen&rsquo;s house. They all lived there for a while. The youngest queen didn&rsquo;t know her son was really a handsome man because the princess never told her, since her husband told her not to tell anyone.</p>
<p>One evening, King Jabhu&rsquo;s servants had a big party with music and dancing in the king&rsquo;s yard. The king, his sons, and other kings all came to watch. Prince Monkey said to his wife, &ldquo;I want to go watch the party, too!&rdquo; So, he took off his monkey fur, folded it up, and put it under her pillow. Then, he put on the clothes that came from the sky when he threw the ball. When he came to the party, everyone said, &ldquo;Who is that? Who can he be?&rdquo; He was very handsome and had golden hair! After staying for a while, Prince Monkey went back to his wife quickly, and in the morning, he put his monkey fur on again.</p>
<p>Now, the youngest queen, his mother, was glad her monkey son had such a wife, but she didn&rsquo;t understand why her daughter-in-law was so happy with him. &ldquo;How could you marry him?&rdquo; she would ask. &ldquo;Because I wanted to,&rdquo; the princess would answer. &ldquo;How can you be so happy with him?&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I love him!&rdquo; said the princess. The queen wondered about this more and more.</p>
<p>Well, one day there was another party, and Prince Monkey went to it, but he left his fur under his wife&rsquo;s pillow. As soon as he left, she called the youngest queen and said, &ldquo;See, you think my husband is a monkey. He&rsquo;s not a monkey, he&rsquo;s a handsome man! There&rsquo;s no one like him, he&rsquo;s so beautiful!&rdquo; The queen didn&rsquo;t believe her. Then, the princess took the fur from under her pillow. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when your son puts this on, he&rsquo;s a monkey. When he takes it off, he&rsquo;s a handsome man. I think I&rsquo;ll burn this fur, and then he&rsquo;ll always be a man. What do you think?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you sure it won&rsquo;t hurt him if you burn his fur?&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll get sick or die if it&rsquo;s burned!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no, he won&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;Should I burn it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Burn it!&rdquo; said the queen. Then, the princess threw the fur on the fire and burned it all up.</p>
<p>Prince Monkey was watching the party when suddenly, he felt like his wife had burned his fur! He jumped up and went home. When he found out it was true, he was angry with his wife! He wouldn&rsquo;t say anything except, &ldquo;Why did you burn my fur?&rdquo; He was so mad that he went straight to bed and fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning, while he was sleeping, the princess went to the youngest queen and said, &ldquo;Come see your handsome son!&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said the queen. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! Come!&rdquo; said Princess Jahuran. Then, the youngest queen went with her, and when she saw her handsome son, she was so happy! The prince opened his eyes, saw her, kissed her, and they were all very happy.</p>
<p>The news spread, and King Jabhu, his sons, and everyone came to see if it was true. When they saw the handsome young prince with golden hair, they were so surprised that they fell down! Prince Monkey helped his father up, hugged him, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your son! Don&rsquo;t fall down before me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you wear that monkey fur?&rdquo; asked his father. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my mother ate the mango seed instead of eating the mango, and so I was born with this fur. The world told me to wear it until I found a wife!&rdquo; His brothers said, &ldquo;Who would have guessed there was such a handsome man inside that monkey fur? Everything happens for a reason!&rdquo; They stopped being mean to their brother, Prince Monkey.</p>
<p>There were big celebrations, and everyone was happy. The six older brothers lived with their father and Prince Monkey, but none of them ever got married.</p>
