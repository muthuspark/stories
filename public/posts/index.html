<p>A long time ago, in a jungle, a donkey and a tiger had a big argument.</p>
<p>The donkey said, &ldquo;The grass is blue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger said, &ldquo;No, the grass is green!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their argument got so loud that they decided to ask the jungle king, the lion, to settle it.  They went to see the lion on his throne.</p> </p>

<p>Once upon a time, a king&rsquo;s elephant was eating grass near a small hill.  He heard a hungry little sound.</p>
<p>It was a dog eating leftover food from the elephant keeper&rsquo;s plate. The keeper wasn&rsquo;t around.  The elephant was used to being alone, so he didn&rsquo;t mind the dog at first.</p> </p>
