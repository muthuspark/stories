<p>Once upon a time, there was a king named King Dantal. He had lots of money, soldiers, and horses! He also had a son, Prince Majnun. He was a very cute boy with bright white teeth, red lips, sparkly blue eyes, rosy red cheeks, red hair, and super pale skin. Prince Majnun loved to play with his best friend, Husain Mahamat, who was the son of the king&rsquo;s helper. They played in King Dantal&rsquo;s big garden, which was full of yummy fruits, pretty flowers, and tall trees. They would even use their little toy knives to cut the fruits and eat them! King Dantal also hired a teacher to teach them how to read and write.</p>
<p>One day, when they had grown up to be fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his dad, &ldquo;Husain Mahamat and I really want to go hunting!&rdquo; His dad said they could go, so they got their horses ready and packed everything they needed for their trip. They rode all the way to the Phalana country, hunting along the way. But all they found were silly jackals and birds!</p>
<p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: Prince Majnun, now a handsome young man (same characteristics as before but older), rides on horseback with Husain Mahamat through a lush, green landscape.

In the distance, a sign indicates the Phalana country with unique architecture and rolling hills." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-laili1.png" width="1024" height="721">

</p>
<p>The ruler of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili. She was very, very beautiful! She had gentle brown eyes and shiny black hair.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 698; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: A dream sequence. Laili, a beautiful young woman with gentle brown eyes and shiny black hair, sleeps peacefully in her bed. Above her, an angelic figure (looking like a handsome man with wings) hovers, pointing towards an image of Prince Majnun (same features as previously defined).

Laili&rsquo;s bed is ornate and luxurious, showcasing her royal status." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-laili2.png" width="698" height="1024">

</p>
<p>One night, before Prince Majnun visited her dad&rsquo;s kingdom, Laili was sleeping soundly. While she slept, someone like an angel came to her in a dream, looking like a man. He told her that she had to marry Prince Majnun and no one else. It was a super important command! When Laili woke up, she told her dad all about the angel&rsquo;s visit, but her dad didn&rsquo;t believe her. After that, she kept repeating, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo; She wouldn&rsquo;t say anything else. Even when she was eating, she would say, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo; Her dad got really annoyed. &ldquo;Who is this Majnun? I&rsquo;ve never even heard of a Majnun!&rdquo; he would say.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 641; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: A humorous scene. Laili, sitting at a dining table laden with food, repeatedly exclaims &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo; Her father, Munsuk Raja, a frustrated king with a exasperated expression, throws his hands up in the air in exasperation. Servants stand around looking bewildered. The dining hall is richly decorated, adding to the comical contrast." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-laili3.png" width="641" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m supposed to marry!&rdquo; Laili would say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not allowed to marry anyone but Majnun!&rdquo; She was almost going a little crazy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat arrived to hunt in the Phalana country. As they were riding around, Laili came out on her horse to get some fresh air. She rode behind them, and kept saying, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo; The prince heard her and turned around. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s calling me?&rdquo; he asked. Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him, she fell head-over-heels in love! She said to herself, &ldquo;That must be Prince Majnun, the one I&rsquo;m supposed to marry!&rdquo; So she went home to her dad and said, &ldquo;Dad, I want to marry that prince who came to your kingdom! I know he&rsquo;s Prince Majnun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, you can marry him,&rdquo; said Munsuk Raja. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask him tomorrow.&rdquo; Laili agreed to wait, even though she was super excited. But that night, the prince left the Phalana kingdom! When Laili heard he was gone, she went totally bonkers. She wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her dad, mom, or servants. She ran off into the forest and wandered further and further away from her home. She kept saying, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo; She wandered like this for twelve whole years!</p>
<p>After those twelve years, she met a wise old man&ndash;he was really an angel in disguise! He asked her, &ldquo;Why do you keep saying, &lsquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun&rsquo;?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I need to find Prince Majnun. Can you tell me where his kingdom is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll ever get there,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really far away, and you have to cross lots of rivers!&rdquo; But Laili said she didn&rsquo;t care. She had to see Prince Majnun! &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;When you get to the Bhagirathi river, you&rsquo;ll see a big fish. You need to get him to take you to Prince Majnun&rsquo;s country, or you&rsquo;ll never make it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked and walked, and finally she got to the Bhagirathi river. There was a huge fish! He was yawning just as she got there, so she jumped right down his throat and into his tummy! She kept saying, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun!&rdquo; This made the fish really scared, so he swam down the river as fast as he could. He got tired after a while and started swimming slower. Then a crow landed on his back and said, &ldquo;Caw, caw!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Crow,&rdquo; said the poor fish, &ldquo;Can you see what&rsquo;s inside my tummy that&rsquo;s making so much noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the crow. &ldquo;Open your mouth wide, and I&rsquo;ll fly down and take a look.&rdquo; So the fish opened his mouth, and the crow flew down. But he came back up really fast! &ldquo;You have a monster in your tummy!&rdquo; said the crow, and he flew away. This made the fish even more worried. He swam and swam until he reached Prince Majnun&rsquo;s country. Then he stopped. A jackal came down to the river to drink. &ldquo;Oh, jackal,&rdquo; said the fish, &ldquo;Can you tell me what I have inside me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; said the jackal. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see unless I go inside you!&rdquo; So the fish opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down. But he came up quickly, looking scared! &ldquo;You have a monster in your tummy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t run away, it&rsquo;ll eat me!&rdquo; So he ran off. After the jackal, a big snake came along. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the fish, &ldquo;Can you tell me what&rsquo;s in my tummy? It&rsquo;s rattling around and saying, &lsquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snake said, &ldquo;Open your mouth wide, and I&rsquo;ll go down and see.&rdquo; The snake went down. When he came back, he said, &ldquo;You have a monster in your tummy! But if you let me cut you open, it&rsquo;ll come out!&rdquo; &ldquo;If you do that, I&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo; said the fish. &ldquo;Oh, no, you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the snake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you medicine that will make you all better!&rdquo; So the fish agreed. The snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili!</p>
<p>She was very old now. She had wandered in the forest for twelve years, and she had lived inside the fish for twelve years! She wasn&rsquo;t beautiful anymore, and she had lost all her teeth! The snake put her on his back and carried her into the country. Then he put her down, and she wandered until she got to Majnun&rsquo;s court, where King Majnun was sitting. Some men heard her crying, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo; They asked her what she wanted. &ldquo;I want King Majnun!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, &ldquo;An old woman outside wants to see you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bring her in here.&rdquo; They brought her in, and the prince asked her what she wanted. &ldquo;I want to marry you!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Twenty-four years ago, you came to my dad&rsquo;s kingdom, and I wanted to marry you then! But you left without me. Then I went crazy, and I&rsquo;ve been looking for you all these years!&rdquo; Prince Majnun said, &ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray to whoever is in charge,&rdquo; said Laili, &ldquo;To make us both young again. Then we can get married!&rdquo; So the prince prayed, and a voice said, &ldquo;Touch Laili&rsquo;s clothes, and they&rsquo;ll catch fire. When they&rsquo;re on fire, you and her will become young again!&rdquo; When he touched Laili&rsquo;s clothes, they caught fire, and she and he became young again! There were big parties, and they got married. Then they went to the Phalana country to see her mom and dad.</p>
<p>Laili&rsquo;s mom and dad had cried so much for her that they had gone blind. Her dad kept repeating, &ldquo;Laili, Laili, Laili!&rdquo; When Laili saw that they were blind, she asked to whomever is in charge to give them back their sight, and they did! As soon as her mom and dad could see her, they hugged and kissed her. They had another wedding party with lots of fun. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years, and then they went back to King Dantal and lived happily with him for a while.</p>
<p>They liked to go hunting, and they often went to different countries to have fun and see new things.</p>
<p>One day, Prince Majnun said to Laili, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go through this jungle!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Laili. &ldquo;If we go through this jungle, something bad will happen to me!&rdquo; But Prince Majnun laughed and went into the jungle anyway. As they were walking, someone in charge thought, &ldquo;I wonder how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be sad if she died? Would he marry someone else? I&rsquo;ll find out!&rdquo; So they sent an angel looking like an wise old man into the jungle. The angel went up to Laili and threw some powder in her face. Right away, she fell to the ground as a pile of ashes!</p>
<p>Prince Majnun was really sad when he saw his dear Laili turned into ashes. He went straight home to his dad and was sad for a long, long time. After a lot of years, he started feeling better and went back to his dad&rsquo;s beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wanted his son to get married again. &ldquo;I only want Laili for my wife! I won&rsquo;t marry anyone else!&rdquo; said Prince Majnun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you marry Laili? Laili is gone! She&rsquo;ll never come back!&rdquo; said the father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t get married at all!&rdquo; said Prince Majnun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her as a pile of ashes. As soon as Majnun left, the wise old man had cleaned up her ashes and mixed them with clay and water. He made a woman figure out of them, and Laili came back to life! But Laili was a scary old woman again, with a long nose and teeth like tusks! Just like when she came out of the fish. She lived in the jungle and didn&rsquo;t eat or drink, and she kept saying, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 801;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: A dramatic scene in a dark jungle. An old woman, Laili, now very old and scary, with a long nose and teeth like tusks, stands amidst the trees, crying out &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!&rdquo;. She is tattered clothing. Behind her, a wise old man (an angel in disguise) watches with a compassionate gaze. Moonlight filters through the trees, casting eerie shadows and highlighting Laili&#39;s sorrow. In the background, a small white dog hides amongst the bushes." src="/posts/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-laili4.png" width="1024" height="801">
    </div>

</p>
<p>Finally, the angel who had thrown the powder at her said to whoever is in charge, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of this woman sitting in the jungle crying forever, &lsquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun,&rsquo; and not eating or drinking? Let me take her to Prince Majnun!&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said whoever is in charge, &ldquo;You can do that, but tell her not to talk to Majnun if he&rsquo;s scared of her. If he is scared, she&rsquo;ll turn into a little white dog the next day. Then she has to go to the palace and will only become human again when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the angel came to Laili again as a wise old man and carried her to King Dantal&rsquo;s garden. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You have to stay here until Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden. Then you can show yourself to him. But don&rsquo;t talk to him if he&rsquo;s scared of you. If he is scared, you&rsquo;ll become a little white dog tomorrow!&rdquo; Then he told her what to do as a little dog to turn back into a human.</p>
<p>Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass. Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was very old now, and Husain Mahamat looked a lot older than Prince Majnun, who had become young again when he married Laili.</p>
<p>As Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat walked in the garden, they picked fruit like they did when they were little kids. But they bit the fruit instead of cutting it. While Majnun was eating fruit and talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned around and saw Laili walking behind. &ldquo;Oh, look, look!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;See what&rsquo;s following you! It&rsquo;s a monster! It&rsquo;s going to eat us!&rdquo; Laili looked at him sadly and shook with age and excitement, but this just scared Majnun more. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monster! A monster!&rdquo; he cried. He ran to the palace with Husain Mahamat. As they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a monster in the garden that was going to eat them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said his dad. &ldquo;Imagine two grown men being scared of an old lady! If it was a monster, it would have eaten you!&rdquo; King Dantal didn&rsquo;t believe Majnun until Husain Mahamat said the prince was telling the truth. They searched the garden for the scary old woman, but found nothing. King Dantal told his son he was silly to be so scared. But Prince Majnun didn&rsquo;t want to walk in the garden anymore.</p>
<p>The next day, Laili turned into a cute little dog. She came into the palace, and Prince Majnun loved her. She followed him everywhere and went hunting with him. She helped him catch animals, and Prince Majnun fed her milk, bread, or anything else he was eating. At night, the little dog slept in his bed.</p>
<p>But one night, the little dog disappeared. In her place was the scary old woman who had scared him in the garden. Prince Majnun was sure she was a monster or something horrible that was going to eat him. &ldquo;What do you want? Oh, don&rsquo;t eat me! Don&rsquo;t eat me!&rdquo; he cried. Poor Laili answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me? I&rsquo;m your wife, Laili, and I want to marry you. Remember when you went through that jungle, even though I begged you not to go because something bad would happen to me? Then a wise old man threw powder in my face, and I turned into ashes! Then someone gave me my life back and brought me here after I cried for you in the jungle for a long time. Now I&rsquo;m a little dog, but if you marry me, I won&rsquo;t be a little dog anymore!&rdquo; Majnun said, &ldquo;How can I marry an old woman like you? How can you be Laili? You&rsquo;re a monster!&rdquo; He was really scared.</p>
<p>In the morning, the old woman had turned back into a little dog. The prince went to his dad and told him everything. &ldquo;An old woman! Always an old woman!&rdquo; said his dad. &ldquo;You only think about old women. How can a strong man like you be so scared?&rdquo; When he saw that his son was scared and thought the old woman would come back at night, he told him to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll marry you if you can make yourself young again. How can I marry an old woman like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, as he trembled in bed, the old woman was there instead of the dog, crying, &ldquo;Majnun, Majnun! I want to marry you! I&rsquo;ve loved you for so long. When I was a girl in my dad&rsquo;s kingdom, I knew about you, even though you didn&rsquo;t know me. We would have gotten married if you hadn&rsquo;t left so suddenly. I followed you for years!&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said Majnun. &ldquo;If you can make yourself young again, I&rsquo;ll marry you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laili said, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy. Someone will make me young again. In two days, you need to go into the garden and look for a beautiful fruit. Pick it and bring it to your room. Cut it open very gently when you&rsquo;re all alone. Don&rsquo;t open it with your dad or anyone else, because I&rsquo;ll be in the fruit without any clothes on!&rdquo; In the morning, Laili turned into a little dog and disappeared into the garden.</p>
<p>Prince Majnun told his dad everything. His dad told him to do what the old woman said. In two days, he and Husain Mahamat walked in the garden. They saw a big, beautiful red fruit. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;I wonder if my wife is in that fruit!&rdquo; Husain Mahamat wanted him to pick it, but he waited until he told his dad. His dad said, &ldquo;That must be the fruit. Go and pick it!&rdquo; So Majnun broke the fruit off and said to his dad, &ldquo;Come with me to my room while I open it. I&rsquo;m scared I&rsquo;ll find a monster that will eat me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said King Dantal. &ldquo;Remember, Laili will be naked. Go alone and don&rsquo;t be afraid if there&rsquo;s a monster. I&rsquo;ll stay outside the door, so you can call me if you need me. The monster won&rsquo;t be able to eat you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Majnun took the fruit and started to cut it open, shaking with fear. When he cut it, out stepped Laili. She was young and more beautiful than ever! Majnun fainted from her beauty!</p>
<p>Laili took off his head scarf and wrapped it around herself (because she didn&rsquo;t have any clothes). Then she called King Dantal and said sadly, &ldquo;Why did Majnun fall down? Why won&rsquo;t he talk to me? He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of me before, and he&rsquo;s seen me so many times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Dantal answered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re so beautiful! You&rsquo;re more beautiful than ever! But he&rsquo;ll be happy soon.&rdquo; Then the King got some water and splashed it on Majnun&rsquo;s face. He gave him some to drink, and he sat up again.</p>
<p>Then Laili said, &ldquo;Why did you faint? Didn&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s me, Laili?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Prince Majnun. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re Laili. Your eyes are so beautiful that I fainted when I saw them!&rdquo; They were all happy. King Dantal had everyone play music, and they had a big wedding party. They gave presents to the servants and lots of money to the wise old men.</p>
<p>After a while, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to have fun. They rode on the same horse with only one helper. They came to another kingdom with a beautiful garden. &ldquo;We have to go into that garden!&rdquo; said Majnun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said Laili. &ldquo;It belongs to a bad ruler, Chumman Basa, a very mean man!&rdquo; But Majnun wanted to go in. Even though Laili told him not to, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. As he was looking, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming. She knew he wanted to kill her husband and take her. So she said to Majnun, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go! Don&rsquo;t go near that bad man! I see that he&rsquo;s going to kill you to take me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Majnun. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a good ruler. Anyway, I&rsquo;m too close to him to run away now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Laili, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better if you&rsquo;re killed than me. If I get killed again, I won&rsquo;t get my life back. But I can bring you back to life if you get killed!&rdquo; Chumman Basa was close now and seemed nice. But when he was talking to Majnun, he pulled out his sword and cut off the prince&rsquo;s head in one swing!</p>
<p>Laili stayed on her horse. As the ruler came towards her, she said, &ldquo;Why did you kill my husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I want to take you!&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Laili.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can!&rdquo; said the ruler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me then!&rdquo; said Laili. Chumman Basa reached out to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife. It got super long in one second! Then Laili swung her arm, and Chumman Basa&rsquo;s head came off with one touch!</p>
<p>Then Laili slipped off her horse and went to Majnun&rsquo;s body. She cut her finger, and blood like medicine came out. She put Majnun&rsquo;s head on his shoulders and smeared the blood on the wound. Majnun woke up and said, &ldquo;I slept so well! I feel like I slept for years!&rdquo; Then he got up and saw the ruler&rsquo;s body by Laili&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Majnun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the mean ruler who killed you to take me, like I said he would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who killed him?&rdquo; asked Majnun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; answered Laili. &ldquo;I brought you back to life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the poor man back to life if you can!&rdquo; said Majnun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Laili, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mean and will try to hurt you!&rdquo; But Majnun kept asking her to bring the ruler back to life. She said, &ldquo;Get on the horse and ride far away with the helper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do if I leave you?&rdquo; said Majnun. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful!&rdquo; said Laili. &ldquo;But this man is so mean, he might kill you again if you&rsquo;re close to him!&rdquo; So Majnun got on the horse with the helper and waited for Laili.</p>
<p>Then she put the ruler&rsquo;s head on his shoulders and squeezed her finger until the blood medicine came out. She smeared it on the wound. As she saw the ruler opening his eyes, she ran away fast! She ran so fast that she ran faster than the ruler, who tried to catch her. She jumped on the horse behind her husband, and they rode fast until they reached King Dantal&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>Prince Majnun told everything to his dad, who was surprised and angry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky to have such a wife!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you listen to her? You would be dead without her!&rdquo; Then he had a big party and gave money to the wise old men. He loved Laili so much. He couldn&rsquo;t do enough for her. He built a beautiful palace for her and his son with lots of land and gardens. He gave them wealth and lots of servants. But he wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone but their servants enter their gardens and palace. He wouldn&rsquo;t let Majnun or Laili leave. &ldquo;Laili is so beautiful that someone might kill my son to take her away!&rdquo; said King Dantal.</p>
