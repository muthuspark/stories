<p>A long, long time ago, in a small village, lived a shepherd boy. Every day, he took his sheep to graze on a small hill near the village.</p>
<p>He was bored of doing the same thing every day.  So, to have some fun, he played a trick. He shouted loudly up the hill, &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf! A wolf is chasing the sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the villagers heard his shout, they rushed to the hill to chase away the wolf. But when they got there, they didn&rsquo;t see any wolf. The boy was happy to see their angry faces. He enjoyed this trick.</p>
<p>All the villagers warned the boy, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout &lsquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rsquo; when there is no wolf!&rdquo;  They went back down the hill, very angry.</p>
<p>The next day, for fun, the shepherd boy shouted again, &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf! A wolf is chasing the sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing his voice, the villagers ran towards the hill again. The boy saw the villagers running to scare away the wolf and felt happy.</p>
<p>When they saw there was no wolf, they scolded the boy again, telling him he should only call for help if there was a real wolf. The boy smiled to himself as the villagers went down the hill.</p>
<p>After a few days, the boy saw a real wolf approaching his flock!  He was scared and jumped up and down, shouting as loud as he could, &ldquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rdquo; But this time, the villagers thought he was playing a trick again, and they didn&rsquo;t come to help.</p>
<p>At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn&rsquo;t returned with his sheep. When they reached the hill, they found the boy crying next to his dead sheep.</p>
<p>Seeing the villagers, the boy said, &ldquo;There really was a wolf! I shouted, &lsquo;Wolf! Wolf!&rsquo; but you didn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>An old man went to comfort the boy, putting his hand on his back.  He said, &ldquo;No one believes a liar, even when he&rsquo;s telling the truth! Your little trick cost many sheep their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd boy understood his mistake. He never played tricks on the villagers again.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Never tell lies or play mean tricks. It can hurt you and others.  People won&rsquo;t trust you if you lie.</p>
