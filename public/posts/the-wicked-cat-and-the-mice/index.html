    <p>A long time ago, there was a wicked cat who always bothered lots of mice.  The mice decided they needed to solve this problem. So, they all gathered to discuss their biggest problem: this wicked cat who chased them and ate them!  &ldquo;This is chaos!&rdquo; squeaked one mouse angrily.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a lively mice council meeting.  A group of small, brown mice with large, expressive eyes are gathered in a circle, their fur rendered with delicate watercolor washes. One older, slightly larger mouse with grey fur is speaking, his paw raised. In the background, a shadowy, sleek black cat with piercing green eyes is subtly depicted, lurking just out of reach.  The overall palette is warm and earthy, with splashes of brighter color indicating the mice&rsquo;s excitement and worry. The scene is set in a cozy mouse hole, with textures suggested through loose watercolor application. Focus on conveying the mice&rsquo;s anxious energy and the cat&rsquo;s ominous presence. Style: whimsical, slightly naive watercolor." src="/posts/images/image_the-wicked-cat-and-the-mice0.png" width="1024" height="537">

<p>&ldquo;We need to find a solution that warns us when the cat is coming!&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we find a solution quickly?  The cat might see us!&rdquo; worried a little mouse.</p>
<p>An old mouse raised his paw and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find a quick solution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mice started brainstorming.  One suggested, &ldquo;We should have a lookout!&rdquo; Another said, &ldquo;We should all travel in groups to avoid being eaten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, a clever mouse had an idea. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tie a bell around the cat&rsquo;s neck! Then, when the cat walks around, the bell will ring, warning us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 851;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor scene showing the mice&rsquo;s brainstorming session.  The mice, consistently depicted as brown with large eyes, are huddled together, their bodies rendered with soft, slightly textured watercolor washes.  One mouse is pointing excitedly to a small, delicate watercolor bell, its shiny surface suggested by highlights.  The scene should be set within a warm, inviting mouse hole, with the textures of wood and soft materials suggested through watercolor techniques.  A small, almost hidden, black cat peeks from a corner, its form subtly suggested in dark washes. Style:  detailed and whimsical watercolor, emphasizing the contrast between the mice&rsquo;s optimistic planning and the looming threat of the cat." src="/posts/images/image_the-wicked-cat-and-the-mice2.png" width="1024" height="851">

</p>
<p>All the mice agreed.  &ldquo;This is the best idea!&rdquo; they cheered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay! But who will tie the bell around the cat&rsquo;s neck?&rdquo; asked the old mouse.</p>
<p>Silence! One by one, all the mice quietly ran away.  Only the old mouse was left.</p>
<p><strong>The moral of the story:</strong>  It&rsquo;s not enough to just talk about a problem; you need to take action to solve it. Think carefully before you speak!</p>
