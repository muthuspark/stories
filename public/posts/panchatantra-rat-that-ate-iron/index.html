        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting Jeev, a slender figure in muted greens and browns, returning home from his journey.  He carries a small, intricately detailed iron scale.  A merchant, rendered in richer, darker tones, stands opposite him, his face etched with disbelief.  A mischievous glint in Jeev’s eyes contrasts with the merchant&rsquo;s angry expression.  In the background, a suggestion of a bustling village marketplace, rendered with loose, colorful washes, adds to the lively atmosphere.  The colors are vibrant but slightly muted, suggesting a warm, sunny day." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-rat-that-ate-iron1.png" width="761" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a merchant&rsquo;s son named Jeev.  Jeev wasn&rsquo;t very lucky with his business. He lost all his money!</p>
<p>Jeev decided to travel to a new place to try and get lucky again. He had a special iron scale from his family, but he needed money for his trip. So, he borrowed money from a nearby merchant and left his scale as a promise to pay back the money.</p>
<p>Jeev&rsquo;s trip went well! When he came home, he went to the merchant to get his scale back. But the merchant said, &ldquo;The rats ate your scale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeev knew the merchant was lying. He said, &ldquo;If rats can eat iron, then anything is possible!&rdquo;  He asked the merchant&rsquo;s son to help him carry his things to the river so he could take a bath.</p>
<p>After his bath, Jeev took the merchant&rsquo;s son to a cave, hid him inside, and blocked the entrance with a big rock! Then he went back to the merchant.</p>
<p>The merchant asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my son?&rdquo; Jeev said, &ldquo;A big bird, a flamingo, flew down and carried him away!&rdquo;  The merchant was angry and didn&rsquo;t believe him.  He took Jeev to the village elder to complain.</p>
<p>The elder also didn&rsquo;t believe Jeev.  Jeev said, &ldquo;If rats can eat iron, why can&rsquo;t a flamingo carry a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder was surprised! Jeev told the whole story. Everyone laughed at the merchant who had been tricking Jeev. The elder made the merchant return Jeev&rsquo;s scale and get his son back from the cave.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how Jeev got his scale back!  Sometimes, a little trickery is needed to be fair.</p>
