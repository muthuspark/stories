<p>A long time ago, in a jungle, a donkey and a tiger had a big argument.</p>
<p>The donkey said, &ldquo;The grass is blue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger said, &ldquo;No, the grass is green!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their argument got so loud that they decided to ask the jungle king, the lion, to settle it.  They went to see the lion on his throne.</p>
<p>Before the lion could even say anything, the donkey shouted, &ldquo;Your Majesty, is it true that the grass is blue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion, wanting to be done with it quickly, said, &ldquo;Yes, the grass is blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 606;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="An image showing the donkey happily walking away with a big smile on his face, while the tiger sits quietly in the background looking dejected." src="/posts/images/image_the-donkey-and-the-tiger10.png" width="1024" height="606">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The donkey was so happy! He said, &ldquo;The tiger disagreed with me and annoyed me! Please punish him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion said, &ldquo;The tiger will be punished with five years of silence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The donkey happily went on his way, saying, &ldquo;The grass is blue! The grass is blue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 784; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="A picture of the jungle with green grass, but the tiger sitting in front of it looking puzzled and the donkey standing next to him, still shouting" src="/posts/images/image_the-donkey-and-the-tiger200.png" width="784" height="1024">
    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The tiger accepted his punishment, but then he asked the lion, &ldquo;Your Majesty, why did you punish me? The grass is green!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion said, &ldquo;Actually, the grass <em>is</em> green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger asked, &ldquo;Then why did you punish me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion explained, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t about whether the grass is blue or green.  You are a brave and clever tiger! It&rsquo;s not right for you to waste your time arguing with a donkey, and then bother me with such a silly question!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion continued, &ldquo;Arguing with someone who is stubborn and doesn&rsquo;t care about the truth is a waste of time.  Some people only care about being right, even if they are wrong.  They don&rsquo;t want to listen to anything else, no matter how much proof you show them.  Sometimes, people are just blinded by their anger and pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tiger listened quietly, hung his head, and went home.</p>
