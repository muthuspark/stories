        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting depicting the climax of the story: Dharma, in calming blues and greens, calmly faces a group of village elders (depicted with simple, neutral colors) near a burning tree. Papa, in vibrant oranges and reds, is shown fleeing the scene in a state of panic and shame, while his father emerges from the burning tree, smoke swirling around him.  The overall style should be expressive and dramatic, capturing the moment of truth and the swift justice that follows. The background should be a simple, slightly chaotic portrayal of the village gathering, utilizing muted browns and greys." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-right-mind-and-wrong-mind2.png" width="1024" height="720">

<p>Once upon a time, in a village, lived two friends: Dharma (Good-Mind) and Papa (Bad-Mind). Papa was poor and didn&rsquo;t know how to make money. He decided to trick Dharma!</p>
<p>Papa said to Dharma, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s travel to another kingdom to earn lots of money! We&rsquo;ll have great stories to tell our grandkids!&rdquo; Dharma agreed.</p>
<p>They worked hard, and Dharma&rsquo;s skills helped them earn so much money!  Soon, they decided to go home.</p>
<p>On their way, Papa said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dangerous to carry all this money. Let&rsquo;s bury it and only take a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dharma trusted Papa and they buried most of the money. But that night, Papa secretly went back and took all the money!</p>
<p>Days later, Papa told Dharma, &ldquo;I spent all my money! Let&rsquo;s get more from the tree.&rdquo;  They dug, but the money was gone!</p>
<p>Papa blamed Dharma! He shouted, &ldquo;You stole it!&rdquo; Dharma said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; They went to the village elders.</p>
<p>Papa suggested asking the tree spirit who stole the money.  Secretly, Papa told his dad to hide in the tree and say Dharma stole it!</p>
<p>The next day, everyone went to the tree. Papa asked the tree spirit, and Papa&rsquo;s dad shouted from the tree, &ldquo;Dharma stole the money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dharma was clever! He saw the tree hollow and set it on fire. Papa&rsquo;s dad ran out, burned and scared! He told the truth.</p>
<p>The elders punished Papa for being sneaky and lying. They praised Dharma for being smart and good.  The story shows us: It&rsquo;s important to choose good friends!</p>
