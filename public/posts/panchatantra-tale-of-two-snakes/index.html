        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene: A thin prince, depicted with pale skin and light blue clothing, sleeps peacefully under a lush green tree. A princess, with vibrant orange clothing and dark hair, stands beside him, looking concerned.  Two vibrant green snakes, one emerging from an anthill, and the other from the prince&rsquo;s mouth, face each other in a lively argument.  In the background, a temple with soft golden hues is visible, implying a distant kingdom.  The overall style should be light, slightly fantastical and charming, with soft watercolor washes creating a dreamlike effect." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-tale-of-two-snakes0.png" width="1024" height="714">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a prince who was very, very skinny!  His dad, the king, was sad because no doctor could help him.  The prince was sad too.  He felt sick all the time.</p>
<p>One day, the prince ran away! He went to a new kingdom and lived in a temple.  He was kind and ate whatever people gave him.</p>
<p>This kingdom had a king with two clever daughters. One day, the king got mad at one daughter because she said something he didn&rsquo;t like.  He told his helpers to find a husband for her, just anyone!</p>
<p>The helpers found the prince!  They got married.</p>
<p>The princess was nice and loved her husband very much. They decided to travel to a new place.</p>
<p>One day, the prince was sleeping under a tree. The princess went to buy food. When she came back, she saw a snake coming out of an anthill and another snake coming out of her husband&rsquo;s mouth!</p>
<p>The snakes started arguing! The anthill snake said, &ldquo;If the prince drinks a special soup, you will die!&rdquo; The snake from the prince&rsquo;s mouth said, &ldquo;If someone pours hot water on my anthill, I will die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess was very smart. She made the special soup for her husband, and he got better! Then, she poured hot water on the anthill, and they found two pots of gold!</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting: The scene should show the happy ending. A healthy, slightly fuller prince (pale skin, light blue clothing) embraces a joyful princess (vibrant orange clothing, dark hair) against a background of golden light and two gleaming golden pots overflowing.  The style should use a bright and cheerful palette, with soft watercolor washes to depict happiness and prosperity. Two tiny, faded green snakes are barely visible, symbolizing the resolved conflict. The overall feel should be warm, inviting, and celebratory." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-tale-of-two-snakes2.png" width="1024" height="588">

<p>The prince and princess were happy and rich! They lived happily ever after.  The story shows us that sometimes, when bad things argue, good things can happen!</p>
