The monkey, a vibrant orange-brown with large expressive eyes, is perched on a lush green berry tree laden with red berries beside a flowing river.

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting focusing on the monkey&rsquo;s clever escape. The monkey, in shades of warm brown, is high up on the berry tree, looking down at the crocodile, a dull olive green, who is swimming back towards the shore, looking crestfallen.  The berry tree is detailed, with ripe red berries hanging heavily from its branches. The background shows a blurry, impressionistic watercolor depiction of the jungle and river. The overall palette is warm, but the crocodile is depicted in cooler tones to highlight his loss and regret.

<p>Once upon a time, there was a big jungle.  A river flowed near the jungle. On a berry tree beside the river lived a monkey.</p>
<p>Every day, the monkey ate delicious berries. One day, he saw a crocodile resting under the tree. The crocodile looked tired and hungry. The monkey thought, maybe the crocodile is hungry too! So, he gave some berries to the crocodile.</p>
<p>The crocodile thanked the monkey for the berries. Soon, they became best friends and spent a lot of time together. Now, the monkey gave berries to the crocodile every day. They both enjoyed eating the berries.</p>
<p>One day, the monkey gave the crocodile extra berries for his wife. He wanted them to share the berries. But the monkey didn&rsquo;t know about the crocodile&rsquo;s wife! She was a very naughty crocodile.</p>
<p>When she ate the berries, she got a bad idea. She told her husband, &ldquo;If these berries are so sweet, then the monkey&rsquo;s heart must be even sweeter! I want to eat his heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crocodile was worried at first, but he did what his wife wanted.  They planned to trick the monkey and eat him!</p>
<p>The next day, the crocodile went to his friend. He told the monkey that his wife wanted to meet him because she loved the berries so much.</p>
<p>The monkey and the crocodile started swimming towards the crocodile&rsquo;s house. The crocodile carried the monkey on his back.  As they swam, the crocodile told the monkey about his wife&rsquo;s plan to eat his heart!</p>
<p>The monkey was scared! But he was also very clever. He quickly said, &ldquo;Oh no! I left my heart on the berry tree. Your wife wants to eat it! I need to go back and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silly crocodile believed him and turned around. As soon as they reached the tree, the monkey quickly climbed up.</p>
<p>From the top of the tree, he shouted, &ldquo;Does anyone keep their heart on a tree?  No one can live without a heart! You broke my trust by listening to your wife! We can never be friends again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sad crocodile, having lost his friend, went back to his wicked wife.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> We should choose our friends carefully and not be tricked easily.  Use your brains and be patient when you have problems.  Never trick your friends!</p>
