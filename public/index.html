<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor, blind dad and mom who depended on their son to help them get by. Every day, the son would go out and ask people for food. He did this for a long time, but he got really tired of living such a tough life. So, he decided to try his luck in a different place.</p> </p>

<p>Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, when King Brahma-datta was in charge of Benares, the future Buddha was born as his son! When it was time to give the little prince a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew up big and strong, and when he turned sixteen, he went to a special school called Takkasila. There, he learned all sorts of amazing things. After his dad, the king, passed away, he became the new king and promised to be fair and kind to everyone.</p> </p>

<p>One day, when Rakesh was six years old, he walked home from the Mussoorie market eating cherries. They tasted a little sweet and a little sour. They were small, bright red cherries that had traveled all the way from the Kashmir Valley.</p>
<p>In the Himalayan hills where Rakesh lived, there weren&rsquo;t many fruit trees. The ground was rocky, and the cold winds didn&rsquo;t let most plants grow very big. But on the slopes that weren&rsquo;t as windy, there were forests of oak and deodar trees.</p> </p>

<p>One day, the wrestler without a daughter heard about the wrestler with the daughter. He decided he wanted to wrestle him to see who was the strongest! So, he went to Ajit&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s town. When he got to their house, he knocked and said, &ldquo;Hello? Is anyone home?&rdquo; Ajit answered, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; and she came outside. The wrestler asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wrestler who lives here?&rdquo; Ajit said, &ldquo;My dad took three hundred carts to the forest to get wood. He&rsquo;s pulling them himself because he couldn&rsquo;t find enough horses or cows to help!&rdquo; The wrestler was super surprised.

It was nighttime. This jungle was called the &ldquo;Tigers&rsquo; Jungle&rdquo; because only tigers lived there. No birds, no bugs, no other animals – just four hundred tigers! As soon as Barber Hím got to the jungle, he saw a big tiger walking around. &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This tiger is going to eat me for sure!&rdquo; He grabbed his razor and the leather strap he used to sharpen it and started making his razor really sharp.

Next to him, the broken clay pot is visible with spilled porridge.  In a semi-transparent overlay above him, fainter watercolors illustrate scenes from his dream: a rich, bustling landscape with happy animals (goats, cows, buffaloes, horses) and a large house, all rendered in warmer colors, showcasing the wealth and family he dreamt of. Soma Sharma, a small, brightly colored figure, is clearly seen amongst the animals, creating a sense of happy chaos. The scene should depict the stark contrast between the reality of poverty and the fleeting richness of the dream." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-brahmins-dream2.png" width="1024" height="1024">

He rides a powerful, muscular white horse, its mane flowing in the wind. In the background, on the side of a dusty road with cracked earth and scattered pebbles, a sinister-looking, shadowy monster with glowing red eyes is mid-transformation into a beautiful queen with flowing dark hair and a deceptively alluring smile. The sky is a blend of orange, pink, and purple, casting long shadows. Emphasis on the contrast between the king&rsquo;s vibrant colors and the monster&rsquo;s dark, ominous presence.

The king is subtly implied by a large, slightly rumpled section of the white bedsheets. The overall color palette should be soft and muted, mostly whites and creams with accents of soft grey and dark brown, reflecting the muted tone of the story.  Mandavisarpini is positioned near the king&rsquo;s form, appearing small and delicate, while the bug is slightly further away, looking toward Mandavisarpini with a sly expression." src="/posts/images/image_panchatantra-bug-and-poor-flea0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

His expression is slightly anxious.  Outside, a smaller, clever-looking jackal, a light reddish-brown, with sharp features, is shown just outside the cave entrance, looking at the lion with a mixture of suspicion and relief, having just heard the lion’s roar. The background is a wash of cool blues and purples for the twilight sky and darker greens for the jungle foliage.
