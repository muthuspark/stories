<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor, blind dad and mom who depended on their son to help them get by. Every day, the son would go out and ask people for food. He did this for a long time, but he got really tired of living such a tough life. So, he decided to try his luck in a different place.</p> </p>

<p>Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, when King Brahma-datta was in charge of Benares, the future Buddha was born as his son! When it was time to give the little prince a name, they called him Prince Brahma-datta. He grew up big and strong, and when he turned sixteen, he went to a special school called Takkasila. There, he learned all sorts of amazing things. After his dad, the king, passed away, he became the new king and promised to be fair and kind to everyone.</p> </p>

<p>One day, when Rakesh was six years old, he walked home from the Mussoorie market eating cherries. They tasted a little sweet and a little sour. They were small, bright red cherries that had traveled all the way from the Kashmir Valley.</p>
<p>In the Himalayan hills where Rakesh lived, there weren&rsquo;t many fruit trees. The ground was rocky, and the cold winds didn&rsquo;t let most plants grow very big. But on the slopes that weren&rsquo;t as windy, there were forests of oak and deodar trees.</p> </p>

In the foreground, a clever jackal, distinguished by its unique coloring and posture, observes the scene.  Two crows, consistent in size, shape and color, are depicted—one holding a glittering gold necklace, the other looking on anxiously.  The background shows a glimpse of a city with a shimmering lake, hinting at the location where the necklace was retrieved.

<p>One day, all the animals went to Bhasuraka and said, &ldquo;Please, Mr. Lion! You kill too many of us.  Just one animal a day is enough for you to eat. Let&rsquo;s make a deal: we&rsquo;ll give you one animal each day, and you won&rsquo;t hunt anymore.&rdquo;</p> </p>
