        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a compassionate saint, depicted with gentle, flowing robes in warm ochre and brown, repeatedly rescuing a small, detailed scorpion (dark brown/black with a subtle, iridescent sheen) from a rushing stream rendered in cool blues and greens.  The saint&rsquo;s expression remains serene throughout multiple repetitions of the rescue. In the background, a small figure of a doctor (wearing a lighter blue and white outfit) observes the scene with a surprised expression, holding a stick.  The style should be reminiscent of traditional Indian miniature paintings, emphasizing the narrative and moral lesson. The overall palette should be soft and harmonious." src="/images/image_the-scorpion-and-the-saint0.png" width="1024" height="760">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor illustration showing a narrative sequence: Panel 1: A tiny scorpion, realistically detailed, struggling in a swiftly moving stream (turbulent blues and greys). Panel 2: The saint (light beige robes, halo subtly suggested) gently rescues the scorpion. Panel 3: The scorpion stings the saint&rsquo;s hand (focus on the detail of the sting). Panel 4: The doctor (simple, outlined figure in muted greens) uses a stick to move the scorpion to safety.  The saint&rsquo;s face maintains unwavering kindness throughout.

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a saint (consistent light orange robes, calm facial features) rescuing a tiny, intensely colored black scorpion repeatedly from a vibrant, rushing stream (deep blues and emerald greens).  The stream is depicted with dynamic brushstrokes.  A smaller figure of a doctor (observing in the background, wearing a simple, light blue outfit) witnesses the events. The style should be loose and expressive, with emphasis on the contrast between the saint&rsquo;s unwavering compassion and the scorpion&rsquo;s instinctive nature. The background could feature soft washes of grey to suggest a rainy day.  The color palette should have a sense of warmth despite the rainy setting." src="/images/image_the-scorpion-and-the-saint2.png" width="1024" height="709">

<p>It was a rainy day. A little scorpion was being swept away by a fast-flowing stream.  A kind saint saw the scorpion struggling and carefully picked it up with his hand.</p>
<p>But, because scorpions like to sting, the scorpion stung the saint!  The scorpion fell back into the stream.</p>
<p>The saint, being very kind, picked up the scorpion again.  And guess what? The scorpion stung him again! This happened a few more times.</p>
<p>A doctor lived nearby, and he saw what was happening. He ran over and used a stick to move the scorpion far away.</p>
<p>He asked the saint, &ldquo;You know scorpions always sting. Why did you keep saving it even after it hurt you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The saint smiled and said, &ldquo;A scorpion can&rsquo;t change its nature, so why should I change mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the doctor bowed down to the saint in respect.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong>  Even when things are difficult, we shouldn&rsquo;t change who we are!</p>
