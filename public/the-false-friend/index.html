    <p>Once upon a time, a deer and a crow were best friends. They were always there for each other, through thick and thin.</p>
<p>One day, the crow saw the deer with a sly fox.  The crow warned the deer, &ldquo;Foxes are very tricky! They trap everyone. You should not be friends with him!&rdquo; But the deer didn&rsquo;t listen and went to the field with the fox.</p>
<p>Guess what? The deer got caught in a trap! The fox said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call the farmer. He&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;</p>

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a deer and a crow, the deer a warm brown with large, expressive eyes, the crow a deep charcoal grey with bright, inquisitive eyes.  Both are consistently sized and shaped throughout the painting.  The background shows a sun-drenched field with a partially visible, rustic wooden trap.  The deer is caught in the trap, looking fearful, while the crow perches nearby, watching with concern.  Use soft, muted colors for a gentle, storybook feel. Emphasize the contrast between the deer&rsquo;s fear and the crow&rsquo;s alertness. Style: whimsical watercolor illustration." src="/images/image_the-false-friend0.png" width="1024" height="726">

<p>The deer cried out.  Just then, the crow arrived and said, &ldquo;Deer, pretend you&rsquo;re dead! Lie very still.&rdquo; The deer did as his friend said.</p>
<p>Soon, the farmer came. He saw the deer and thought it was dead.  He was happy! He opened the trap to take the deer away.  But as soon as the trap opened, the deer ran away!</p>

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 822;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="A single watercolor painting showing the deer and crow as main characters. The deer, a light caramel brown with large, gentle eyes, is running away from a dark brown wooden trap with its legs slightly splayed, indicating just escaping. The crow, a deep grey-blue, flies alongside, its wings spread in a dynamic pose. In the background, a farmer with a red coat and angry expression is seen far away, chasing a small orange fox. The style should emulate children&rsquo;s book illustrations: simple, charming, and slightly naïve. Focus on the joy of escape, with the deer and crow’s bodies and expressions conveying relief and friendship." src="/images/image_the-false-friend2.png" width="1024" height="822">

<p>The farmer was very angry. He was angry at the fox for tricking him and he chased the fox away.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Don&rsquo;t trust anyone blindly.  Always check if someone is a good friend before you trust them completely.</p>
