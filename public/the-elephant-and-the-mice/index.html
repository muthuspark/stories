    <p>A long, long time ago, there was a very old village that had been damaged by an earthquake. No people lived there anymore.  But in this empty village, a whole bunch of mice made their home.</p>
<p>Near the village was a big lake. A herd of elephants used to go to the lake every day to drink water. To get to the lake, they had to walk through the village.</p>
<p>One day, as the elephants walked through, they accidentally stepped on many mice! The mice were very scared and upset.</p>
<p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>The leader of the mice bravely went to talk to the elephants. He asked them to use a different path to the lake, and promised to help them if they ever needed it.</p>
<p>The elephants laughed! They thought, &ldquo;How can such tiny mice ever help us big elephants?&rdquo; But they were kind, so they promised to use a different path.</p>
<p>Some days later, something terrible happened.  Hunters caught the elephants and trapped them in big nets!</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>When the mice heard this, they rushed to help! They used their sharp teeth to chew through the ropes and nets, freeing the elephants.</p>
<p>

    </div>

    
</figure>
</p>
<p>The elephant leader thanked the mice again and again. He finally understood that you shouldn&rsquo;t laugh at someone because of their size.  Everyone has special skills!</p>
