<p>Once upon a time, in a small village, lived a very grumpy old man.  He was known as the unluckiest man in the world! Everyone in the village was tired of his constant complaining. He was always sad and in a bad mood.  The older he got, the grumpier he became, and his words felt like poison. People avoided him because his unhappiness seemed to rub off on others.  If you met him, your day felt unlucky! It was hard, and even felt strange, to be happy near him.</p>
<p>His sadness made everyone else sad too.</p>
<p>But one day, when he turned eighty years old, something amazing happened! The news spread like wildfire through the village: &ldquo;The old man is happy! He isn&rsquo;t complaining, he&rsquo;s smiling, and he even looks refreshed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole village gathered in front of his house.  Everyone wanted to know, &ldquo;What happened to you today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled and said, &ldquo;Nothing special! For eighty years, I chased happiness, but it never came. So, I decided to live without chasing happiness and just enjoy life.  And now, I&rsquo;m happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Don&rsquo;t chase happiness; enjoy life!</p>
