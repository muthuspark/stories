        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a heartwarming yet cautionary tale. A simple farmer, depicted with warm earth tones (browns, oranges) and a kind face, and his wife, in complementary soft yellows and greens, are shown in their small village home.  They are consistently sized and shaped throughout the painting.  The farmer is depicted in two scenes: one happily tending to a plump, healthy hen (bright yellow feathers with subtle orange highlights) who lays a single, glistening golden egg.  In the second, smaller scene, the farmer is sorrowfully staring at the empty hen, which is now dull and lifeless, demonstrating the consequences of greed. The background uses soft watercolor washes of blues and greens to depict the village and fields." src="/images/image_the-hen-that-laid-golden-eggs0.png" width="1024" height="680">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration: A farmer (consistent earthy tones, simple features) and his wife (consistent soft, warm colors, simple features) are centrally positioned.  The hen, a vibrant yellow with subtle orange accents, is depicted three times: once healthy and laying a shining golden egg, once being held sadly by the farmer before being killed, and finally as a lifeless carcass, showing the transformation in her appearance. The size and shape of the characters remains consistent. The background should have a muted watercolor style with soft browns and greens, illustrating the farmer&rsquo;s simple life and showing the change from abundance to loss." src="/images/image_the-hen-that-laid-golden-eggs1.png" width="1024" height="573">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor artwork:  Focus on the emotional journey. The farmer (consistent brown clothing, simple facial features) and wife (consistent soft green dress, simple facial features) are depicted in three distinct scenes: 1) Joyful, smiling, receiving a golden egg from a vibrant, healthy hen (bright yellow). 2) The farmer, with a conflicted expression, about to harm the hen.  3) The farmer and his wife, grief-stricken, staring at the lifeless hen. The hen&rsquo;s size and shape is consistent throughout, with a changing color palette reflecting its condition (vibrant yellow to dull yellow to lifeless gray). Consistent use of watercolors with muted background colors (blues, greens)." src="/images/image_the-hen-that-laid-golden-eggs2.png" width="1024" height="574">

<p>Once upon a time, in a small village, a farmer and his wife lived together.  The farmer loved to buy hens from the market and take care of them.</p>
<p>One day, he brought home a new hen. He loved and cared for her, and she grew healthy and strong.</p>
<p>After a few months, the hen laid an egg! But this wasn&rsquo;t just any egg – it was a golden egg!</p>
<p>The farmer and his wife were amazed!  The hen laid a golden egg every day, and they sold them for lots of money.  But then, greed crept into their hearts.</p>
<p>The farmer thought, &lsquo;If she lays one golden egg every day, how many more must be inside her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came up with a terrible plan. He killed the hen and cut it open, hoping to find many more golden eggs. But guess what?  There were no more eggs inside!</p>
<p>The farmer and his wife were very, very sorry. They had killed their hen and lost all their golden eggs. They learned a valuable lesson that day.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Greed is bad.  It&rsquo;s always better to be happy with what you have.</p>
