<p>Once upon a time, in a nearby forest, a hungry donkey was sadly crying.  He was sad because his owner hadn&rsquo;t fed him properly after a long day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>A sly jackal was passing by and saw the hungry donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, donkey?&rdquo; asked the jackal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very hungry! I&rsquo;ve eaten everything here, but I&rsquo;m still hungry!&rdquo; cried the donkey.</p>
<p>Hearing the donkey&rsquo;s sad story, the jackal said, &ldquo;Oh, you know there&rsquo;s a big field of fresh vegetables nearby. You can go there and eat your fill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please take me there!&rdquo; said the donkey.</p>
<p>The jackal took the donkey to the field. Once there, they quietly munched on the fresh vegetables.  Suddenly, they heard someone coming! They both ran away.</p>
<p>From then on, both animals went to the vegetable garden every day and ate their fill. But one day, their luck ran out. A farmer saw them and chased them away!</p>
<p>That day, both animals were hungry. As night fell, the jackal suggested they sneak back into the vegetable garden for another feast.</p>
<p>Under the cover of darkness, the donkey and the jackal crept into the field and began to eat.  While eating, the donkey had an idea.  &ldquo;Oh, look at these delicious cucumbers and the beautiful moon! It&rsquo;s so lovely, I want to sing a song!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now! You can&rsquo;t sing here!&rdquo; said the jackal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to sing!&rdquo; the donkey said angrily.</p>
<p>The jackal tried to explain, &ldquo;The farmer will hear you! We might get caught!&rdquo; But the donkey wouldn&rsquo;t listen and started to sing.</p>
<p>A little way off, the farmer and his family heard a donkey braying. They ran towards the donkey with sticks.</p>
<p>They chased the donkey away, beating him as they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch-ouch-ouch!&rdquo; cried the donkey in pain, running back to the jackal and telling him everything.</p>
<p>Hearing his story, the jackal said, &ldquo;You should have waited until we were out of the field before singing! You didn&rsquo;t listen to me, and now you&rsquo;ve been hurt. Come on, you need some rest! Don&rsquo;t ever do that again!&rdquo;  The jackal then went away.</p>
<p>The donkey was punished for his actions, but he also learned a valuable lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> There&rsquo;s a right time and place for everything. Always think about the best time and place to do things!</p>
