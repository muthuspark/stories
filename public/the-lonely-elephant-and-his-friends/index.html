    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 1024;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a heartwarming scene in a lush jungle.  A large, gentle elephant, painted in muted browns and greys, stands amidst a group of smaller animals: a bright orange monkey swinging from a vine, a fluffy white rabbit peeking from behind a large fern, and a small green frog perched on a lily pad.  In the background, a slightly blurred,  fiery orange lion is depicted running away, while a brown bear watches from the safety of a tree. The overall style should be whimsical and slightly naive, emphasizing the emotional story. The elephant should have a kind expression, and the other animals should show relief and happiness.  Use soft, blended watercolor washes to create a sense of unity and calm." src="/images/image_the-lonely-elephant-and-his-friends0.png" width="1024" height="1024">

Panel 2: The elephant, same muted greys/browns, conversing with a small, bright red monkey, a tiny white rabbit, and a lime-green frog, all clearly expressing rejection. Panel 3:  The elephant, larger than the other animals but painted with a softer touch, bravely confronting a fierce orange lion, who is rendered with sharp, dark lines. Panel 4: The elephant, smiling, surrounded by happy friends—the monkey, rabbit, frog, and bear—all in their consistent colors from earlier panels. The watercolor style should showcase a clear narrative progression." src="/images/image_the-lonely-elephant-and-his-friends1.png" width="828" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting depicting a vibrant jungle scene. In the foreground, a large, friendly-looking elephant (muted browns and grays) is playfully interacting with a monkey (bright orange), rabbit (white with pink ears), frog (bright green), and bear (brown). The lion (fiery orange) is depicted in the background, small and fleeing from the scene. Use a loose, expressive watercolor style, incorporating plenty of green foliage and vibrant flowers.  The overall mood should be joyful and celebratory, highlighting the elephant&rsquo;s newfound friendships and the vibrant jungle environment.  Maintain consistency in the animals&rsquo; colors and sizes throughout the image." src="/images/image_the-lonely-elephant-and-his-friends2.png" width="654" height="1024">

<p>A long time ago, a lonely elephant wandered into a strange new jungle. He didn&rsquo;t know anyone there and wanted to make some friends.</p>
<p>First, he met a monkey.  &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Monkey! Want to be my friend?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The monkey said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t swing like me, you&rsquo;re too big! I can&rsquo;t be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, the elephant asked a rabbit the same question.</p>
<p>The rabbit replied, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too big to fit in my burrow! I can&rsquo;t be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, he asked a frog in the pond.</p>
<p>The frog said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too heavy to jump as high as me! I can&rsquo;t be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant felt very sad. He had tried so hard, but couldn&rsquo;t make any friends.</p>
<p>One day, he saw all the animals running around in a panic. He asked a bear, &ldquo;Why are you all running?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bear said, &ldquo;The jungle&rsquo;s lion is hunting! We&rsquo;re running away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the elephant went to the lion and said, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t hurt these innocent animals. Please leave them alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion laughed and told the elephant to go away.  The elephant got angry and pushed the lion with all his might! The lion got hurt and ran away.</p>
<p>The other animals slowly came out, happy that the lion had lost. They went to the elephant and said, &ldquo;Your size is perfect for being our friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elephant smiled and started playing with his new friends.</p>
<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong>  Size doesn&rsquo;t matter! Anyone can be helpful, so don&rsquo;t underestimate anyone.</p>
