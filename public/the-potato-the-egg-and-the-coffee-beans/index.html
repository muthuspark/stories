        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a father and son, John.  The father, with warm brown hair and wearing a light blue shirt, is slightly larger than John, who has dark brown hair and a red shirt. Both have kind, expressive faces. They are seated at a simple wooden table. Three bowls are on the table, one containing a soft, light-brown potato, one a slightly larger white egg, and a smaller bowl of dark brown coffee beans.  The bowls are partially filled with clear water.  The background is a soft, muted yellow watercolor wash, suggesting a warm, comforting kitchen.  The style should be gentle and illustrative, focusing on the emotional connection between the father and son. The color palette should be warm and inviting, with earthy tones and subtle blues and yellows." src="/images/image_the-potato-the-egg-and-the-coffee-beans0.png" width="1024" height="728">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting three separate scenes in a horizontal triptych.  The left panel shows John, with dark brown hair and a red shirt, looking sad and alone, his tears subtly represented in watercolor washes. The middle panel shows the father, with warm brown hair and a light blue shirt, gently guiding John&rsquo;s hands as they explore the textures of a potato, egg, and coffee beans in separate bowls. The right panel displays the same father and son, now smiling, the father pointing to the transformed potato, hard-boiled egg, and fragrant coffee-infused water.  The color palette should remain consistent, emphasizing warm colors and soft transitions. The style should be whimsical, almost storybook-like, and highly evocative of the emotional journey." src="/images/image_the-potato-the-egg-and-the-coffee-beans1.png" width="1024" height="489">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 1024; --h: 766;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor painting featuring a close-up view of the three bowls – potato, egg, and coffee beans –  after boiling. The potato is soft and pale, showing peeling skin. The egg is smooth and white with a slightly darker, opaque texture. The coffee beans are dark and rich, surrounded by darkly shaded coffee-colored water. The scene is framed by subtle watercolor washes of pale yellow and soft blue, creating a sense of tranquility.  A smaller, partially visible image of the father (warm brown hair and light blue shirt) and John (dark brown hair and red shirt) is present in the background, barely visible, to show the context. The style should be expressive and detailed, focusing on the textural contrast between the three elements." src="/images/image_the-potato-the-egg-and-the-coffee-beans2.png" width="1024" height="766">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named John.  John was very sad. His dad found him crying.</p>
<p>His dad asked John why he was sad. John said he had lots of problems.</p>
<p>His dad smiled and asked John to bring a potato, an egg, and some coffee beans. He put them in three separate bowls.</p>
<p>Then, he asked John to feel their textures.  After that, he told John to fill each bowl with water.</p>
<p>John did just as he was told.  His dad then boiled all three bowls.</p>
<p>Once the bowls were cool, John&rsquo;s dad asked him to feel the textures again.</p>
<p>John saw that the potato was soft, and its skin peeled off easily. The egg had become hard.  And the coffee beans? They had completely changed! They had filled the water with a wonderful smell and taste.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s dad said, &ldquo;Son, problems in life make us stronger and ready for the future. So, instead of running away from problems, we should try to solve them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John felt much better! He knew how to handle his problems now.</p>
<p><strong>The lesson of the story:</strong> Life will always have problems.  We need to solve our problems to be happy!</p>
