        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of four brown and beige bulls with large, dark horns, standing together in a lush green jungle.  One bull is slightly separated, looking sad. A sly-looking orange lion, smaller than the bulls, is hidden in the shadows of the jungle, watching them.  The style should be reminiscent of classic children&rsquo;s book illustrations, with soft, slightly muted colors. The background should be filled with vibrant green foliage and dappled sunlight." src="/images/image_the-lions-trick0.png" width="1024" height="616">

One bull is slightly wounded.  The scene is dynamic, with splashes of color suggesting movement and struggle. The bulls should be depicted with determined expressions, their horns prominent. The lion should be shown with a fierce yet slightly fearful expression. Use loose, expressive watercolor washes to create a sense of energy and movement." src="/images/image_the-lions-trick1.png" width="1024" height="622">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of the four brown and beige bulls, standing shoulder to shoulder, horns pointed towards the viewer, after defeating the lion. They look proud but relieved, slightly muddied and with leaves clinging to their fur. The orange lion is in the background, defeated and retreating into the lush green jungle. Use a palette of earthy greens, browns, and oranges with a focus on texture and detail in the fur and horns of the bulls. The style should evoke a sense of triumph and friendship." src="/images/image_the-lions-trick2.png" width="1024" height="999">

<p>Once upon a time, in a thick jungle, lived four friendly bulls. They were best friends and always stayed together.  A lion lived in the same jungle. He wanted to eat one of the bulls, but he was too scared to attack them all at once. The bulls were big and strong, and their horns were scary!</p>
<p>The lion tried and tried, but he could never catch a bull alone. They always stuck together, helping each other.  One day, the lion had a clever idea. He decided to trick the bulls into fighting each other!</p>
<p>He went to one bull and whispered, &ldquo;Your friends say you&rsquo;re very silly!&rdquo;  The bull felt sad and stopped talking to his friends.  The lion did this to each of the bulls, making them angry with each other.</p>
<p>When the bulls were no longer friends, the lion attacked one of them. But the other three bulls saw this and rushed to help! They fought the lion bravely and saved their friend.  One bull said, &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t silly to fall for the lion&rsquo;s trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> We should always trust our friends and not let anyone trick us into fighting with them.</p>
