        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a proud deer with large, intricately detailed antlers and slender legs.  The deer is drinking from a tranquil pond, its reflection showing only its head and antlers. The background is a lush, dark green forest. The deer is a light brown, with consistent coloring throughout the painting.  Use muted greens and browns for the forest. The pond should reflect a soft, muted light. In the upper right corner, add a small, subtle depiction of God listening to the deer&rsquo;s complaint in the form of faint, almost ethereal light and a single ear." src="/images/image_the-proud-deer0.png" width="760" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting a dramatic scene: A light brown deer with large antlers is entangled in thorny branches, his slender legs visible as he struggles. Hunting dogs, depicted in dark brown and black with dynamic brushstrokes, surround him. The background is a blurred depiction of the forest with a mix of greens and browns, the branches and brush strokes conveying a sense of urgency. Maintain consistent coloring and size of the deer throughout. The dogs should be slightly smaller than the deer, but large enough to showcase the danger." src="/images/image_the-proud-deer1.png" width="987" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting depicting the deer lying injured after the attack.  The deer is light brown, still showing its large antlers but its body is drooping, conveying injury. The antlers are prominently displayed, contrasting with the deer&rsquo;s thin but slightly muddy legs. The background is a watercolor wash of muted greens, browns, and grays, showing the forest floor. The overall mood is one of somber reflection. The deer&rsquo;s expression should reflect remorse and understanding. Maintain the consistent color and size of the deer&rsquo;s body." src="/images/image_the-proud-deer2.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, in a thick forest, lived a deer.  This deer was very proud. One day, he was drinking water from a pond. As he drank, he saw his reflection. He was so happy looking at his beautiful antlers, but he felt very sad seeing his thin legs. He even started complaining to God about them!</p>
<p>One day, some hunting dogs came into the forest and started chasing the deer. The deer was scared and ran away as fast as he could.  His thin legs helped him run very quickly!</p>
<p>But as he ran, his antlers got stuck in some branches! He tried and tried to pull them free, but he couldn&rsquo;t. The hunting dogs caught up and hurt him. He was badly injured and almost died.</p>
<p>As he lay there, he thought, &ldquo;My beautiful antlers got me into trouble! My thin legs could have saved me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The moral of the story:</strong>  Everything is beautiful in its own way.  Being proud of only some of your qualities isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
