        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a storybook scene.  A large, tawny-orange lion, consistently sized and shaped throughout the image, sleeps soundly under a lush green watercolor jungle canopy. A tiny brown mouse, consistently small and the same shape throughout, scampers playfully on the lion&rsquo;s mane. In a separate section of the painting, the same lion is trapped in a dark brown net against a light tan tree trunk, his expression one of frustrated anger. A tiny brown mouse is busily gnawing at the net with determined energy.  Use loose, expressive watercolor washes to depict the jungle setting. The lion and mouse should retain consistent color and shape across both scenes.  Emphasize the contrast in size between the lion and the mouse. Focus on conveying a sense of the story&rsquo;s humor and ultimately, kindness." src="/images/image_the-lion-and-the-mouse0.png" width="1024" height="721">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting two distinct scenes:  In the first, a sleepy, golden-orange lion with a consistent shape and size rests in a vibrant, green jungle setting painted with loose, wet-on-wet watercolor technique.  A small, light brown mouse, consistently sized and shaped, playfully runs over the lion. In the second scene, the same lion is captured in a rough, dark brown net tied to a textured, light brown tree. The same little brown mouse is diligently chewing on the net. The watercolor style should emphasize texture and movement, with soft, blended colors and detailed expressions in both the lion and the mouse. Maintain consistent coloring and shapes for the characters throughout." src="/images/image_the-lion-and-the-mouse1.png" width="730" height="1024">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="A watercolor painting showing a narrative arc.  Panel 1: A large, orange lion with a consistent shape and size, sleeping peacefully beneath a canopy of soft, translucent green watercolor leaves. A small, consistently shaped and colored brown mouse is actively playing on the lion. Panel 2: The same lion, now furious, holds the mouse in its paw. Panel 3: The same lion, captured in a rough-textured, dark brown net against a lighter brown tree. The same mouse, small and brown, is now heroically gnawing at the net to free the lion.

<p>Once upon a time, a lion was sleeping in the jungle.  While the lion was sleeping, a little mouse started playing on the lion&rsquo;s body, running and jumping all over him! This woke the lion up, and he was very angry.</p>
<p>The angry lion caught the mouse.  Just as the lion was about to eat the mouse, the mouse quickly begged the lion to let him go. The mouse promised that if the lion ever needed help, he would do everything he could to help.</p>
<p>The lion found the mouse&rsquo;s bravery funny, so he laughed and let the mouse go.</p>
<p>A few months later, some hunters came to the jungle. They caught the lion in a net and tied him to a tree! The lion tried very hard to free himself, but he couldn&rsquo;t.  He roared loudly in frustration.</p>
<p>His roar was heard far away. A little mouse was passing by, and when he heard the lion&rsquo;s roar, he knew the lion was in trouble.</p>
<p>As soon as the mouse reached the lion, he started to gnaw on the net with his sharp teeth.  Soon, the lion was free!</p>
<p>The lion thanked the mouse, and they both went off happily together into the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson of the story:</strong> This story teaches us to help each other and not to hurt anyone without reason.</p>
