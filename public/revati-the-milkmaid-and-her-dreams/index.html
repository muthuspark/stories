<p>One day, Revati collected milk from her cows. She filled two buckets and set off to the market to sell it.</p>
<p>As she walked, she started daydreaming! She thought about all the things she could buy with the money she would earn.</p>
<p>











<figure class="">

    <div class="img-container" style="--w: 512; --h: 512;">
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Revati walking towards the market, lost in thought, with a trail of milk droplets behind her, symbolizing her carelessness" src="/images/image_revati-the-milkmaid-and-her-dreams20.png" width="512" height="512">

<p>She imagined buying chickens and selling their eggs. Then, with that money, she’d buy a cake, a basket of strawberries, a fancy dress, and even a new house! She made big plans to become rich quickly.</p>
<p>She was so excited about her dreams that she forgot all about the buckets of milk she was carrying!  She started spilling the milk without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt something wet on her feet.  She looked down and saw that her buckets were completely empty! All the milk was gone!  Revati started to cry. She was very sad because she had been so careless.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong>  Dreams are wonderful, but we need to work hard to make them come true. It&rsquo;s important to focus on the present and work hard before we plan for the future.</p>
