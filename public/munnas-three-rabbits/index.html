<p>Munna had three cute, little rabbits. He loved them very much!  Every day, before going to school, Munna would go to the park and bring back fresh, green grass for his bunnies to eat. Then he&rsquo;d go to school and bring more grass for them when he came home.</p>
<p>One day, Munna was late for school. He didn&rsquo;t have time to get grass for his rabbits before he left.  When he came home from school, his rabbits were gone! He looked everywhere but couldn&rsquo;t find them. He asked everyone, but no one had seen them.</p>
<p>Munna was very sad. He cried and cried until his eyes were red. He sat in the park and cried some more.  After a while, he looked up and saw his three rabbits! They were happily eating grass and playing together in the park.</p>
<p>

<p>Munna was so happy! He understood that they must have been hungry, so they went to the park to find food.  He thought, &lsquo;When I&rsquo;m hungry, I ask my mom for food. But these rabbits don&rsquo;t have a mommy.&rsquo;  He felt sad for his rabbits, but also very happy to have found them.</p>
