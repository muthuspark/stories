        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting of a strong lion, consistently colored burnt orange and brown, with a large, slightly exaggerated mane.  The lion is shown falling off a wobbly, hastily constructed seat perched atop a grey elephant, whose size is proportionately larger than the lion.  The background is a lush watercolor jungle scene with vibrant greens and blues.  A small, regal-looking king, in royal purple and gold attire, is subtly visible in the background, sitting securely on his own elephant throne. The lion&rsquo;s expression should show surprise and a hint of pain, his injured leg slightly bent." src="/images/image_the-lions-throne0.png" width="1024" height="574">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor illustration depicting a scene in three parts, panel style. Panel 1: A powerful, burnt orange lion, with consistently sized features, stands proudly amongst smaller, varied jungle animals (monkeys, parrots, etc., using a consistent, muted color palette). Panel 2: The lion sits precariously on a makeshift seat atop a large grey elephant. A small king in purple and gold clothing sits regally on a well-made elephant throne in the background. Panel 3: The lion is on the ground, his leg injured, looking slightly sheepish.  The colors should be consistent across all three panels, with a focus on soft, watercolor washes." src="/images/image_the-lions-throne1.png" width="1024" height="728">

        <img loading="lazy" alt="Watercolor painting emphasizing the contrast between the lion&rsquo;s initial pride and his subsequent fall.  The lion, a consistent burnt orange-brown, is shown in two main scenes. In the first, he is large and imposing, commanding a group of smaller jungle animals (consistently colored and sized) who are building him a seat on an elephant.  The second scene shows the lion lying on the ground after falling from the elephant&rsquo;s back, his injured leg visible; his expression is one of humility. The background should be a soft watercolor wash of jungle greens and blues, with a small figure of a king on an elephant throne visible in the distance." src="/images/image_the-lions-throne2.png" width="1024" height="1024">

<p>Once upon a time, there was a very strong lion in the jungle.  All the other animals were scared of him because he was so powerful!</p>
<p>One day, the king of a nearby city came to visit the jungle. The lion saw that the king was sitting on a beautiful seat on top of an elephant!</p>
<p>The lion really wanted to sit on a seat on an elephant too. He called all the jungle animals and told them to make a seat for him on the elephant&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The animals quickly made the seat. The lion jumped on, excited to sit on his new throne! But when the elephant started walking, the seat wobbled, and the lion fell down with a big <em>BUMP</em>!</p>
<p>His leg was hurt!  The lion limped and said, &ldquo;Walking on my own two feet is much better!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson:</strong>  It&rsquo;s best to do what you&rsquo;re good at. We should try to use our own brains and not copy others.</p>
