Once upon a time, in a small town, lived a kind Brahmin named Drona. Drona was very simple. He didn't wear fancy clothes or use perfumes. He prayed very hard, every day, even when it was hot, cold, or rainy!  Because of this, he was a little thin and his hair and nails were long.

One day, someone gave Drona two baby cows. He loved them and took good care of them, feeding them lots of yummy food.  Soon, they were big and strong!

A sneaky thief saw the cows and wanted to steal them.  He planned to take them at night.

On his way, the thief met a scary demon!  The thief was very frightened.

"Who are you?" asked the thief.

"I'm a demon," the demon boomed. "I always tell the truth, and I hate liars. Tell me who you are!" 

The thief told the truth. He said, "I'm a thief, and I'm going to steal those cows!" 

Surprisingly, the thief and the demon became friends because they were both honest. They made a plan: the demon would eat Drona, and the thief would steal the cows. They went to Drona's house together.

They hid and waited for Drona to fall asleep.  The demon wanted to eat Drona first, but the thief wanted to steal the cows first. They argued loudly!

Their arguing woke Drona up! The thief told Drona about the demon, and the demon told Drona about the thief. 

Drona started to pray. The scary demon ran away! Then Drona chased the thief away with a stick.

The wise say: When bad people fight, good people win!
