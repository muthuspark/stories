title: "The Greedy Man"

![Watercolor painting of a story: A wealthy man, depicted in shades of deep brown and gold, with a slightly plump figure and a stern expression, is embracing his daughter, a small girl with bright pink dress and rosy cheeks, who is now turning golden.  In the background, a whimsical fairy with shimmering teal hair and gown, is partially obscured behind a gnarled, golden tree, her expression a mix of sadness and pity. The overall color palette is warm, with golds and browns contrasting against the cool teal of the fairy and the pink of the girl's dress. Focus on the emotional contrast between the man's greedy expression and the girl’s innocent, now golden, form.  Use loose, expressive watercolor brushstrokes to capture the emotional weight of the scene.](/images/image_the-greedy-man0.png)


Once upon a time, in a small town, lived a very rich, greedy man.  He loved gold and jewels more than anything! But, he loved his daughter more than anything else.

One day, he saw a fairy!  Her hair was caught in the branches of a tree. The kind man helped her free her hair.  But then, his greed took over. He thought, 'I should ask the fairy for a wish! I can get even richer!'

He asked the fairy for a wish, and she granted it. The greedy man said, 'I wish that everything I touch turns to gold!'

The fairy made it so.  The man was so happy! He touched rocks and pebbles, and they turned into gold! He ran home to tell his wife and daughter.

When he got home, his daughter ran to hug him.  He bent down to hug her back, but… oh no!  She turned into a golden statue!  He realized his terrible mistake.

![Watercolor painting: A close-up on the moment the man's daughter transforms.  The man's hand is touching her cheek, the gold spreading like a wildfire across her pink dress and skin.  His face is a mask of horror and regret, painted in dark browns and muted oranges.  His daughter's face, though turning gold, retains a hint of her rosy cheeks, creating a poignant contrast. The background is blurred, hinting at a lush green landscape and a distant, almost ethereal, fairy with shimmering teal hair. Focus on the texture of the watercolor, showing the smoothness of the gold against the rougher texture of the man's clothing and the girl's original skin tone. Use vibrant colors for the initial rosy skin tone and then muted gold for the transforming body.](/images/image_the-greedy-man2.png)

He cried and cried, trying to find the fairy to undo his wish, but he couldn't. He learned a very important lesson: too much greed can lead to sadness and loss.

The End.
