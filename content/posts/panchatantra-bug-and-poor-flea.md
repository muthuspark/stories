The king is subtly implied by a large, slightly rumpled section of the white bedsheets. The overall color palette should be soft and muted, mostly whites and creams with accents of soft grey and dark brown, reflecting the muted tone of the story.  Mandavisarpini is positioned near the king's form, appearing small and delicate, while the bug is slightly further away, looking toward Mandavisarpini with a sly expression.](/images/image_panchatantra-bug-and-poor-flea0.png)


Once upon a time, there was a tiny white flea named Mandavisarpini. She lived on a king's big, fluffy white bed!  She secretly nibbled on the king's blood while he slept.  She was very happy, but one day, a bug came into the king's bedroom.

Mandavisarpini said, "Bug! Get out! You'll get caught!" 

The bug said, "That's not very nice!  Guests should be welcomed. I've tasted lots of blood, but never a king's! It must be yummy! Can I try some?"

Mandavisarpini said, "You have a sharp bite!  I only bite the king when he's fast asleep. You can have some AFTER me, if you promise to wait!"

The bug promised. But when the king went to sleep, the bug couldn't wait! He took a little bite!

The king woke up!  "Something bit me! Find it!" he shouted.

The bug hid quickly. The king's helpers looked everywhere and found Mandavisarpini.  They squished her! The king went back to sleep, and the bug got away.

The story teaches us:  Don't trust people who break their promises!
