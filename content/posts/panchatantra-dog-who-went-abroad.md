![Watercolor painting focusing on Chitranga, a small brown dog with expressive eyes, surrounded by a circle of other similarly colored dogs of similar size and shape.  The scene is dominated by a palette of warm browns, ochres, and muted greens, conveying a sense of home and belonging.   A faint suggestion of a distant house, with a hint of brighter colors depicting food, is barely visible in the background, emphasizing the emotional connection between Chitranga and his fellow dogs over the lure of plentiful food.](/images/image_panchatantra-dog-who-went-abroad2.png)


Chitranga the dog lived in a town with no food.  Everyone was hungry, even the animals!

Many dogs were starving and sad. Chitranga was so hungry, he decided to leave and find food in a new place.

After walking a long way, he found a house with its door open!  Inside, there was lots and lots of yummy food. Chitranga ate until his tummy was full!

But then, other dogs saw him. They didn't know him, so they chased him and nipped him with their teeth!  Poor Chitranga!

He ran away and thought, "My own town is better, even if it's hungry!"  He went back home.

His dog friends asked, "Tell us about the new place! Was there lots of food?"

Chitranga said, "Yes, there was lots of food!  But the other dogs were mean. It's better to be hungry at home with my friends."

Sometimes, it's better to stay with your family and friends, even if things are a little tough!
