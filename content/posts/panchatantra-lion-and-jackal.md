The lion is slightly injured, looking distressed.  The background should suggest a feeling of impending doom, with dark, stormy clouds gathering.

A lion named Vajra lived in the jungle with his friends, a jackal and a wolf.  One day, a sick camel was left behind by a caravan.  The lion ate the camel, but the baby camel was too little to eat, so the lion kept it as a pet. 

The lion, jackal, wolf, and baby camel became best friends and lived happily together.  One day, the lion got hurt and couldn't hunt. He asked his friends to find food, but they came back with nothing.

The hungry jackal had a bad idea. He told the baby camel that to save his friends, he should let the lion eat him. He said the camel would be reborn bigger and better. The kind camel agreed. 

The jackal tricked the lion into thinking the camel wanted to be eaten as a gift to the gods. The lion agreed and the jackal quickly killed the camel.

While the lion went to pray, the sneaky jackal tried to eat the camel all by himself. But the wolf was also hungry and ate some, too! The lion came back and saw the mess and was very angry. He chased the wolf away.

Then, the jackal saw a caravan coming and told the lion it was the god of death, angry about the camel. The scared lion ran away!

The clever jackal ate all the rest of the camel.  But the story shows us that it's not good to be friends with bad people, or you might get into trouble too!
