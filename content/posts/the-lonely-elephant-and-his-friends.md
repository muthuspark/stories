In the foreground, a large, friendly-looking elephant (muted browns and grays) is playfully interacting with a monkey (bright orange), rabbit (white with pink ears), frog (bright green), and bear (brown). The lion (fiery orange) is depicted in the background, small and fleeing from the scene. Use a loose, expressive watercolor style, incorporating plenty of green foliage and vibrant flowers.  The overall mood should be joyful and celebratory, highlighting the elephant's newfound friendships and the vibrant jungle environment.

A long time ago, a lonely elephant wandered into a strange new jungle. He didn't know anyone there and wanted to make some friends.

First, he met a monkey.  "Hello, Mr. Monkey! Want to be my friend?" he asked.

The monkey said, "You can't swing like me, you're too big! I can't be your friend."

Next, the elephant asked a rabbit the same question.

The rabbit replied, "You're too big to fit in my burrow! I can't be your friend."

Then, he asked a frog in the pond.

The frog said, "You're too heavy to jump as high as me! I can't be your friend."

The elephant felt very sad. He had tried so hard, but couldn't make any friends.

One day, he saw all the animals running around in a panic. He asked a bear, "Why are you all running?"

The bear said, "The jungle's lion is hunting! We're running away!" 

Hearing this, the elephant went to the lion and said, "Please don't hurt these innocent animals. Please leave them alone."

The lion laughed and told the elephant to go away.  The elephant got angry and pushed the lion with all his might! The lion got hurt and ran away.

The other animals slowly came out, happy that the lion had lost. They went to the elephant and said, "Your size is perfect for being our friend!"

The elephant smiled and started playing with his new friends.

**The End**

**Lesson:**  Size doesn't matter! Anyone can be helpful, so don't underestimate anyone.
