title: "The Sparrow, the Mouse, and the Hunter"
---

Once upon a time, a flock of sparrows was flying around looking for food.  They spotted a field full of yummy grains!

They all flew down and ate their fill. But oh no! As they tried to fly away, they realized they were stuck! Their feet were tangled in a net a hunter had set.

A tiny grey mouse, with large black eyes, is diligently chewing at the net's edge to free the sparrows. In the background, a blurry figure of a hunter is visible, suggesting urgency. The style should be whimsical and slightly cartoonish, emphasizing the collaborative spirit of the scene.  Focus on warm, inviting watercolor washes.](/images/image_the-sparrow-the-mouse-and-the-hunter0.png)

They struggled and struggled, but the hunter was coming closer!  The sparrow leader cried out, "Stop struggling! Listen to me. Let's fly together to my friend, the little mouse. He can help us!"

Just as the hunter shouted, the sparrows all flew up together, pulling the net with them!

They flew to the forest where a tiny mouse lived.

The sparrow leader said, "Fly towards that tree! My little friend lives there."

Reaching the tree, all the sparrows called out, "Little mouse, little mouse, please help us!"

The little mouse quickly started chewing on the net.  Soon, all the sparrows were free!

The colours should be vibrant and warm.  The scene should be peaceful and joyous, reflecting the successful rescue.  A tiny grey mouse, similar in style to the other images, could be shown peeking out from a hole in the farmhouse, smiling. The watercolor style should be loose and expressive, focusing on light and shadow.](/images/image_the-sparrow-the-mouse-and-the-hunter2.png)

The sparrow leader thanked his friend, saying, "Thank you, dear friend! You saved us all.  We are all so grateful!" The other sparrows thanked the little mouse too.

And all the sparrows flew happily back home.

**Lesson:** We should always face difficulties and never give up. There's strength in working together!
