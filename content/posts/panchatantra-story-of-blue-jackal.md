![Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene: Chandarava, a small jackal consistently colored a vibrant blue, stands proudly amidst a group of larger, diverse jungle animals (lions, tigers, deer, etc.) who look at him with a mix of awe and slight suspicion.  The background is a lush, green jungle with a hint of a village in the distance.  The overall style is playful yet slightly apprehensive, reflecting the story's tone. The blue dye is subtly splashed around Chandarava, indicating his recent escape.](/images/image_panchatantra-story-of-blue-jackal0.png)


Once upon a time, there was a clever jackal named Chandarava.  He was very hungry one day and couldn't find any food! 

So, Chandarava went to a village to look for something to eat.  But the village dogs saw him!  Woof woof! They barked and chased him.  

Chandarava ran and ran! He zoomed into a washerman's house.  There was a big tub of blue dye!  Splash!  Chandarava jumped in and got covered in blue paint. He didn't look like a jackal anymore!

When the dogs saw him, all blue, they were scared!  They didn't know what he was and ran away!

Chandarava went back to the jungle.  He was still blue!  All the other animals were scared of the blue jackal. They thought he was a scary new animal!

Chandarava had an idea! He shouted, "Don't be afraid!  I'm the new king!  Brahma, the great god, made me king! I'm here to protect you all!" 

The animals believed him! They became his subjects. Chandarava told everyone what to do.  He didn't want to be near other jackals though, because he didn't want them to know he was really a jackal.

The lions and tigers hunted for food for Chandarava. He shared the food with everyone.  He was a good king, for a while.

One night, Chandarava heard other jackals howling. He couldn't help it! He started howling too!  The animals heard him and realized he was just a trickster jackal!

"He fooled us!" they cried. They were very angry.  They chased Chandarava and gave him a good scolding!

The story teaches us: It's not good to trick your friends.  Be kind and honest!
