title: "The Farmer and the Well"
---

A long time ago, in a village, lived a hardworking farmer. He grew his own food and sold it to make a living.

One day, he was looking for a water source for his fields. He saw his neighbor's well and bought it.

But the neighbor was very clever! The next day, when the farmer went to get water, the neighbor refused to let him.

The farmer asked why. The neighbor said, "I sold you the well, not the water!" and walked away.

The farmer was upset. He went to the king for justice. He told the king everything.

The king called his wisest minister, Birbal. Birbal asked the neighbor, "Why won't you let the farmer get water? You sold him the well!"

The neighbor replied, "I sold him the well, Birbal, but not the water in it. He has no right to the water."

Birbal thought for a moment. Then he said, "Since you sold the well, you have no right to keep the water in it.  You must either pay the farmer rent for the well, or remove all the water immediately!"

The neighbor realized his trick had failed. He apologized and went home.

The farmer got his well back and thanked Birbal for helping him get justice.
