title: "The Roadblock"

A long, long time ago, a king secretly placed a huge rock in the middle of a road.  He hid nearby in a big bush, wanting to see who would move it. 

![Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene.  A large, grey boulder sits in the middle of a vibrant, yellow dirt road.  A small, round king (wearing a bright blue robe and crown, consistently sized and shaped throughout the piece), hides behind a lush, green bush.  Several figures pass by the rock: two larger, more formally dressed figures (ministers or merchants, wearing muted browns and purples, consistent size and shape) grumbling, while several smaller, more simply dressed figures (villagers) walk around the rock.  A farmer (wearing simple, earthy greens and browns, consistent size and shape), slightly larger than the villagers, is depicted in the foreground straining to push the rock with determined expression. A small golden purse, overflowing with coins, lies near the rock where it once sat. The style should be loose and expressive, emphasizing the vibrant colors and storytelling.](/images/image_the-roadblock0.png)

Many people walked by. But nobody wanted to move the rock! Even the king's ministers and rich merchants passed by and complained, but didn't move it. They blamed the king for the problem!

Lots of people shouted at the king for not keeping the road clean, but none of them tried to remove the rock themselves.

Then, a farmer came along carrying a basket of vegetables.  When he reached the rock, he put down his basket and tried to push the rock off the road. It was hard work, but finally, he did it!

When the farmer went back to get his vegetables, he saw a purse on the road where the rock had been!

The purse was full of gold coins and a note from the king! The note said the gold was a reward for the person who moved the rock.

**Lesson:**  Every problem we face can bring us new chances.  Instead of complaining, let's be ready to solve them!
