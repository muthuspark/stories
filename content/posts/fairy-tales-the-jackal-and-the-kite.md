Once upon a time, there was a jackal and a kite. They lived in the same tree. The jackal lived at the bottom, and the kite lived at the top. Neither of them had any kids. One day, the kite said to the jackal, "Let's pray to God and not eat anything for a while. Maybe then He will give us children!" The jackal said, "Okay, good idea!" That day, the kite didn't eat anything, not even that night. But the jackal waited until night, then secretly brought a dead animal and ate it under the tree. Crunch, crunch, crunch! The kite heard her munching on the bones instead of not eating. "What's that you've got there?" the kite asked. "Why are you making so much noise?" "Oh, it's nothing," said the jackal. "It's just my own bones rattling around inside me when I move!" The kite went back to sleep and didn't pay attention to the jackal. The next morning, the kite ate a little food to honor God. That night, the jackal brought another dead animal. The kite called out, "What are you crunching? Why are you making that noise? I bet you're eating something!" The jackal said, "Oh no! It's just my bones rattling!" So the kite went back to sleep.

The jackal, its fur a mottled mix of browns and tans, sits at the base of the trunk, casting a long, distorted shadow in the late afternoon sun. Its yellow eyes gleam with cunning as it glances upward. The kite, with plumage of soft greys and whites, perches atop the highest branch, feathers ruffled by a gentle breeze. Its expression is contemplative, its dark eyes scanning the horizon. A small, partially eaten animal carcass, rendered in muted browns and reds, lies half-hidden among the tangled roots near the tree's base, partially obscured by deep shadows. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dappled patterns on the ground. The overall tone is suspenseful and mysterious, painted with delicate washes of watercolor and subtle textural details.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-jackal-and-the-kite0.png)

Later, the kite had seven little boys! But the jackal had no children because she didn't really fast. A year later, the kite prayed to God again, asking Him to watch over her children.

The nest, woven from twigs and leaves, is bathed in the golden light of the morning sun. The mother kite, her plumage a warm ochre, offers a juicy worm to one of her fluffy, down-covered chicks. Each chick has a unique expression, ranging from eager anticipation to sleepy contentment. Below, the jackal, its fur a dull grey, watches from the shadowed base of the tree, its face contorted in an envious and grumpy scowl. The sunlight streams through the leaves, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The color palette is vibrant and cheerful, emphasizing the warmth of the family bond.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-jackal-and-the-kite1.png)

One day, which was a special day, the kite put out seven plates. On one plate, she put coconuts, on another cucumbers, on a third rice, on a fourth bananas, and so on. Then she gave a plate to each of her seven sons and told them to take the plates to their aunt the jackal. So the boys took the seven plates and carried them to their aunt, calling out, "Aunty, aunty, look! Mom sent you these!" The jackal took the plates... but instead of being nice, she did something terrible! She chopped off the heads, hands, feet, noses, and ears of the seven boys, and took out their eyes. Then she put all the heads on one plate, the eyes on another, the noses on a third, the ears on a fourth, the hands on a fifth, the feet on a sixth, and the rest of their bodies on the seventh. Then she covered all the plates. She took the plates to the kite and called out, "Here! I brought you something back! You sent me a present, so I'm giving you one too!"

The chicks' expressions are hopeful and innocent, their tiny wings flapping with anticipation. The jackal sits in a patch of dry, cracked earth, her fur matted and dirty. Her eyes gleam with malice, reflected in the light of the midday sun. The background features a dilapidated mud wall, crumbling at the edges. The overall tone is unsettling and foreboding, despite the bright colors of the fruit and the seemingly innocent gesture of the chicks. The artistic style emphasizes the contrast between the innocence of the chicks and the sinister nature of the jackal.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-jackal-and-the-kite2.png)

The poor kite thought the jackal had hurt her seven children, so she cried out, "Oh no! It's too dark to see what you've brought. Just put the plates down in my tree." The jackal put the plates down and went home.

The kite, her form partially obscured by shadows, looks down from her nest built amongst thorny branches, her expression worried and her eyes filled with suspicion. The scene is dimly lit, with only a sliver of moonlight piercing through the dense foliage. The background is dark and foreboding, filled with looming shadows and the suggestion of unseen dangers. The jackal's posture is submissive, but her eyes retain a flicker of cunning. The covered plates emit a faint, unnatural glow. The color palette is muted and somber, creating a sense of unease and impending doom.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-jackal-and-the-kite3.png)

Then, God brought the boys back to life! They came running to their mother, all happy and well. And instead of heads, eyes, noses, ears, hands, feet, and bodies, the plates were filled with coconuts, cucumbers, bananas, rice, and all the yummy things again!

The chicks are depicted with joyful expressions, chasing butterflies and playing with fallen petals. Light fills the scene, casting a warm, golden glow on everything. The mother kite watches over them with a loving gaze, her feathers shimmering in the sunlight. The background is a lush meadow filled with wildflowers. All the kites are smiling, their eyes bright with contentment. The overall tone is peaceful and idyllic, painted with soft, flowing watercolors and delicate details.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-jackal-and-the-kite4.png)

The jackal got hold of the boys again! This time, she did it again! But God brought them back to life again. The jackal was really surprised to see the boys alive. She got angry and said to the kite, "I'm going to take your seven sons and throw them into the water, and they will drown!" "Okay," said the kite. "Take them. I don't mind. God will take care of them." The jackal took them and threw them into the water, and left them there. But the kite watched without crying. And again, God made them alive! The jackal was so surprised. "How is this possible?" she said. "I put these children in the water to drown, and here they are, alive!"

![A watercolor illustration of the jackal throwing the seven kite chicks into a churning, dark river or lake under a stormy sky. The jackal's face is twisted in a mask of desperation and cruelty. The kite watches from the rocky shore, her expression is surprisingly neutral, almost serene, showing a profound faith that transcends understanding. A divine glow surrounds the children in the turbulent water, illuminating their terrified faces. The water is painted in deep blues and purples, reflecting the stormy sky. The overall tone is tragic but also hopeful, suggesting a higher power at play. The painting emphasizes the stark contrast between the jackal's dark actions and the kite's unwavering faith.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-jackal-and-the-kite5.png)

Then God got very angry with the jackal and said to her, "Go away from this village! Wherever you go, people will try to shoot you, and you will always be afraid of them!" So the jackal had to leave. The kite and her children lived very happily ever after!

![A watercolor illustration of the jackal, looking fearful and dejected, running away from a rural village under a dark and stormy sky, its fur matted and muddy. Rain lashes down, blurring the scene. People in the background, silhouetted against flickering torchlight, are aiming bows and arrows, their faces grim with anger. The kite and her seven children watch her departure from their ancient tree in the distance, wreathed in warm sunlight, the tree acting as a symbol of hope and resilience. The scene is divided into two distinct halves: the dark, stormy world of the jackal and the warm, sunlit sanctuary of the kite family. The watercolor style captures the intensity of the storm and the deep emotions of the characters, offering a sense of closure and justice.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-jackal-and-the-kite6.png)
