Wind is on the right, swirling in blues and greys, also looking annoyed. Star should be the largest, and the background has many stars.](/images/image_fairy-tales-how-sun-moon-and-wind-went-out-to-dinner3.png)


One sunny day, Sun, Moon, and Wind went to eat yummy food with their uncle and aunt, Thunder and Lightning. Their mom (she's a super far-away Star way up high!) waited all alone for them to come home.

Now, Sun and Wind were a bit greedy. They loved all the delicious food they got to eat, and they didn't even think about saving some for their mom! But gentle Moon didn't forget. Every time a yummy dish came around, she hid a little bit under her pretty fingernails so her mom could have some too!


When they got back, their mom, who had watched for them all night with her little bright eye, asked, "Hi kids! What did you bring home for me?" Then Sun (who was the oldest) said, "I didn't bring anything home! I went to have fun with my friends, not to get dinner for you!" And Wind said, "Me neither, Mom! You can't expect me to bring you food when I just went out to have fun!" But Moon said, "Mom, get a plate! Look what I brought you!" And she shook her hands and dropped down the most amazing dinner ever!

Then Star looked at Sun and said, "Because you only thought about yourself and had fun without thinking of your mom at home, you will be punished! From now on, your light will be hot and burny, and it will hurt everything it touches. People will not like you and will cover their heads when you come out!"

(And that's why the Sun is so hot even today!)

Then she looked at Wind and said, "You also forgot about your mom and only thought about having fun. You will be punished too! You will always blow when it's hot and dry, and you will make everything dry and wrinkly. People will not like you from now on!"

(And that's why the Wind is so annoying when it's hot!)

But to Moon, she said, "Sweet daughter, because you remembered your mom and saved some of your yummy food for her, from now on you will always be cool, calm, and bright. Your light will be gentle and won't hurt anyone, and people will always say you are wonderful!"

(And that's why the Moon's light is so soft, cool, and pretty even today!)
