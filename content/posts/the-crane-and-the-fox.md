Once upon a time, in a forest, lived a fox and a crane. They were very good friends. One day, the fox saw the crane and said, "Hello Crane! How are you?"

The crane replied, "I'm fine, Fox. How are you?"

The fox had a mischievous idea. She said, "Crane, I'd like to invite you to a feast at my house tomorrow. Please come for dinner."

The next day, the crane went to the fox's house for dinner. They greeted each other and chatted for a while. After some time, the fox brought two shallow plates of very thin porridge.  She said, "Crane, let's eat!" 

The fox ate the porridge quickly, but the crane's long beak couldn't reach the porridge. Seeing this, the fox was secretly happy.  She pretended to be worried and asked, "What's wrong? Don't you like the food?"

The crane understood the fox's trick. After talking for a little while, he said, "Fox, please come to my house for dinner tomorrow."

The fox agreed, "Yes, I'll definitely come."

The next day, the crane cooked some fish and put them in two narrow-necked jugs. When the fox arrived, they greeted each other and talked. After a while, the crane brought the jugs. He said, "Sister, let's eat the fish together!" 

He then dipped his beak into the jug and happily ate the fish. The fox's big mouth couldn't fit into the narrow neck of the jug. She just watched the crane eat. The crane knew the fox had gotten her own back!

**Moral of the story:**  What goes around, comes around.
