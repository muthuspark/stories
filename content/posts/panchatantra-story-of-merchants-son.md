A long time ago, a merchant had a son.  One day, the son bought a very expensive book!  But the book only had ONE sentence inside:  "You get what is destined for you!" 

His dad was SO angry!  "You wasted all that money on one sentence?  Leave my house!" 

The son was sad. He left home with only his book.  He traveled and traveled, always saying, "You get what is destined for you."  People started calling him "You-get-what-is-destined-for-you".

One day, a princess saw him at a party.  She liked him, and by mistake, her helper gave him a secret note meant for the prince! The note said, "I love you! Meet me at my castle window!" 

The son thought, "Okay!"  He climbed up the rope to the princess's room.  It was dark! The princess thought he was the prince, and they ate and talked. Then she turned on the light and saw it wasn't the prince!  She was mad and sent him away.

He was sad again, so he slept in a temple.  The temple's night watchman asked him to sleep at his house.  But the son went to the wrong room!  The watchman's daughter thought he was her boyfriend and they accidentally got married!

The daughter said, "Oops!  That was a mistake!" and sent him away. 

Later, he saw a wedding.  Suddenly, a scary elephant ran at everyone!  The son was brave! He saved the bride!  The bride said, "I will marry HIM!" 

Everyone argued. The King came! He asked the son to explain everything. The son just said, "You get what is destined for you!" 

The princess and the watchman's daughter felt embarrassed because of their mistakes.  The King heard everything. The watchman's daughter said, "It was my destiny, and I don't regret it!" The princess said the same. So did the bride!

The King was happy! He gave the son many villages and made him rich! He married the son to the princess AND the bride AND the watchman's daughter! They all lived happily ever after! The end!
