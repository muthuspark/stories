title: "The Thirsty Crow"
---





Once upon a time, on a hot summer day, a crow was very, very thirsty. He flew here and there, looking for water, but couldn't find any.  The hot sun made him even thirstier! He almost gave up hope. But he didn't! He kept looking, and then... he saw it! A pot with a little bit of water in it. He was so happy! 

![Watercolor painting of a thirsty crow, rendered in muted browns and grays, with bright, expressive eyes.  The crow is perched on the rim of a terracotta pot, which contains a small amount of water at the bottom.  Several smooth, grey pebbles are scattered around the pot and a few are already inside, raising the water level slightly. The background is a sun-drenched landscape in warm yellows and oranges, suggesting a hot summer day.  The crow's body is consistently sized and shaped throughout the painting, maintaining consistent color and style. The style should be reminiscent of classic children's book illustrations.](/images/image_the-thirsty-crow0.png)

He tried to drink, but the water was too low down. He couldn't reach it!  Just as he was about to give up again, he saw some pebbles nearby.  He had a clever idea! He picked up the pebbles, one by one, in his beak and dropped them into the pot. Slowly, slowly, the water level rose!  Finally, there was enough water for him to drink. He drank his fill and happily flew away.

![Watercolor painting in a loose, impressionistic style. The main focus is a crow (dark grey-blue, consistently sized and shaped) happily drinking from a clay pot (terracotta color) with raised water levels. Small grey pebbles are subtly suggested around the pot's base. The background is a blur of sunny yellows and burnt oranges, evoking a feeling of heat and relief. The style emphasizes texture and color blending; the crow's feathers should show soft shading, and the water should look reflective.  The overall mood should be one of cheerful accomplishment.](/images/image_the-thirsty-crow2.png)
