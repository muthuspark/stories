Once upon a time, deep in the jungle, lived a big family of elephants near a pond.  They were happy there, but then the pond started to dry up because it hadn't rained in a long time.

Some elephants told their king, "We need more water!  The baby elephants are thirsty!" 

The king said, "I remember a big, big lake far away. Let's go there!" 

So, the elephants walked for five days and five nights!  Finally, they found the lake. It was full of water! 

But... near the lake lived lots of little bunnies in their cozy burrows.

The elephants were so happy to see the water, they jumped and splashed.  Oops!  They accidentally squished some bunny burrows!  Many bunnies got hurt.

When the elephants left, the bunnies were sad.  "The elephants will come back!" they cried.  "We need to do something!"

One brave bunny said,  "We're small, but we can be clever! I have a plan!" 

The bunny sat on a little hill near the lake.  When the elephant king came back, the bunny shouted, "Stop! This lake belongs to the Moon! You can't come here!" 

The elephant king was scared. He didn't want to make the Moon angry.

The bunny said, "I'm the Moon's messenger!  The Moon saw you hurt the bunnies.  Go away!" 

The elephant king asked, "Where's the Moon? I want to say sorry!" 

The clever bunny pointed to the lake. "The Moon is in the water!  See? Bow down and be quiet. Don't bother him!" 

The elephant king saw the moon's reflection in the water. He was amazed!  He bowed, and he and his family left quickly.

The bunnies were safe!  Even small animals can be very clever and brave.
