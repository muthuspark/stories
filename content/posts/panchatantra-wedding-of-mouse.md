Once upon a time, near a big river, lived some wise people called hermits.  They lived with their teacher, a very special Guru named Yadnyavalkya.  He was always quiet and thinking deeply.

One day, while the Guru was taking a bath, a hawk dropped a tiny mouse right into his hands!  The Guru knew the mouse needed help, so he gently put it on a big leaf. Then he took another bath to be clean.

Using his magic, the Guru changed the mouse into a little girl! He and his wife decided to take care of her like their own daughter. The little girl learned many things and grew up happy.

When she grew up, it was time to find her a husband.  The Guru, using his magic, asked the Sun to marry her. But the girl said, "The Sun is too hot!" 

Next, he asked the King of the Clouds. But she said, "The clouds are too wet and cold!" 

Then he asked the Lord of the Winds.  But she said, "The wind is too fast and always changing!" 

He even asked the Lord of the Mountains.  But she said, "The mountains are too hard and still!" 

Finally, the mountains suggested the King of the Mice.  The girl was very happy to marry him!  The Guru used his magic to change her back into a mouse, so she could live with her new husband.

And that's how the wise Guru's daughter found her perfect match!  It just goes to show, you can't change who you really are!
