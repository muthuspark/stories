![Watercolor painting of a single scene: Haridatta, a kind-faced older man with brown clothing, kneeling before a large anthill, gently offering a bowl of milk to a cobra with a detailed, slightly injured hood. The cobra is a vibrant green, and the anthill is textured and earthy. In the background, a wilting, sun-baked field, rendered in muted browns and yellows, suggests Haridatta's struggling farm.

Once upon a time, there was a farmer named Haridatta. He worked very hard, but his farm wasn't very successful.

One hot day, Haridatta rested under a tree.  Near the tree was an anthill.  Suddenly, a cobra came out! Haridatta thought, "Maybe this cobra is the farm's protector! I'll give it offerings."

Every day, Haridatta offered the cobra milk.  In return, he found a gold coin! He got rich!

Later, Haridatta had to go away. He told his son to give the cobra milk. The son found a gold coin too. But he got greedy!

He thought, "There must be tons of gold in the anthill!"  He tried to kill the cobra!

The cobra bit him, and the son died.  Haridatta was sad, but he didn't blame the cobra. He went back to give milk.

The cobra said, "You're only here for the gold, not out of respect. Our friendship is over." The cobra showed Haridatta his injured hood and gave him a diamond.

Haridatta went home, sad about his son. He never went back to the anthill.  Greed is bad! It can cause big problems.
