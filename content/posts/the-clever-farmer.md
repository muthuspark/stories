![Watercolor painting: A joyful scene of a farmer and his animals (a white goat, a golden-brown lion) by a river.  A small boat is in the foreground, suggesting the successful completion of a problem.  The grass is depicted in a bright, realistic style, contrasting with the more whimsical style of the animals and farmer. A sense of relief and accomplishment should be conveyed in the farmer's expression.  Use a range of watercolor washes to create depth and texture; employ a vibrant color palette while maintaining a consistent style for characters throughout the painting. Style: Slightly whimsical, reminiscent of children's book illustrations.](/images/image_the-clever-farmer2.png)

Once upon a time, there was a farmer. He had a goat, a pile of grass, and a lion. He needed to take them all across a river in a tiny boat!  The boat was so small, he could only take one thing at a time.

If he took the lion first, the goat would eat all the grass!  If he took the grass first, the lion would eat the goat!

The farmer was so worried, he sat down on the ground feeling sad.

But then, he had a clever idea! First, he took the goat across the river and left it there.

Next, he went back and took the lion across. But he brought the goat back to the first side so the lion wouldn't eat it!

Then, he took the grass across to the lion.  He went back alone in the boat.

Finally, he went back and got the goat!  

He got everyone across the river safely!

The farmer was so clever! He showed that with patience and smart thinking, even hard problems can be solved.
