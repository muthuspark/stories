Once upon a time, a salt seller took his donkey to the market every day.  The donkey carried big bags of salt. 

To get to the market, they had to cross a river. One day, the donkey fell into the river!  Splash! The salt bags fell in too. The salt dissolved in the water, making the bags much lighter. 

The donkey was so happy!  It was much easier to carry the light bags. So, the donkey started doing this every day,  making the salt seller lose lots of salt. 

The salt seller knew what the donkey was doing. He wanted to teach the donkey a lesson. The next day, instead of salt, he loaded the donkey with bags of cotton. 

The donkey thought, "This will be easy too!"  But guess what? Wet cotton is very heavy! The donkey had a very difficult time carrying the heavy, wet cotton.  

The donkey learned its lesson that day. It stopped trying to trick its owner. The salt seller was very happy. 

**The Moral of the Story:**  Luck doesn't always work out. It's always better to be clever and kind!
