![Watercolor painting of a dramatic jungle scene. The focus should be on four distinct figures: three in similar attire (flowing robes in shades of olive green and deep turquoise) representing the scholarly friends, and one smaller figure in warm browns and oranges, the clever friend. The three scholars are engaged in reassembling a lion skeleton, which is partially covered in translucent watercolor washes suggesting skin and muscle.  The clever friend, noticeably smaller, observes from a tall tree in the background, his posture and expression conveying worry. The lion's head should be slightly larger than the other elements to emphasize the looming danger.  The overall style should be reminiscent of a classic watercolor illustration, with visible brushstrokes and a focus on texture.](/images/image_panchatantra-lion-that-sprang-to-life2.png)


Four friends lived in a town. Three were very smart and knew lots about holy books.  One friend wasn't as book-smart, but he was really clever! 

The three smart friends decided to travel and use their knowledge to earn money. They wanted to leave the clever friend behind, because they didn't think his cleverness would help them make money. But the clever friend asked to come along, and they agreed to share their money with him.

While traveling through a jungle, they saw a dead lion's bones.  The three smart friends thought they could use their knowledge to bring the lion back to life! The clever friend said, "Don't do that! The lion will kill us!" But they didn't listen.

They put the lion's bones together, added skin and flesh, and started a special ceremony to bring it to life.  The clever friend quickly climbed a tree.

When the lion came back to life, it saw the three friends and attacked them!  The clever friend watched safely from the tree.  After the lion left, the clever friend climbed down and went home.

This story shows that being clever and using common sense is sometimes even better than knowing a lot of things!
