Two little birds, Pip and Pop, lived in a big tree in the jungle. Pip lived in a cozy branch, and Pop lived in a hole at the bottom of the tree.  They were best friends and loved to chat.

One day, Pip flew away with other birds to find yummy food.  Pop waited and waited, but Pip didn't come back. Pop was worried!  He thought, "Where is Pip?  I hope he's okay!" 

Days went by, and Pop still didn't see Pip.  Pop felt sad.  Then, a bunny named Floppy came along and saw the empty hole.  Floppy moved in!

Finally, Pip came home! He had found lots of yummy berries.  He was happy to be back, but then he saw Floppy in his hole!  "Hey! This is my home!" Pip cried.

Floppy said, "No, it's my home now! I found it empty."

Pip and Floppy argued.  Pip said, "Let's ask a wise animal to help!" Floppy agreed.

They found a cat who pretended to be very wise. He sat by a river, holding a special grass, and pretended to be praying.

Pip and Floppy thought he was a holy cat.  They told him their problem, but Pip said, "Let's stay far away. He's still a cat!" 

The cat pretended to be kind. He said, "I'm very peaceful. Come closer, I can't hear you!"

Pip and Floppy trusted him and came close.  But the sneaky cat jumped up and caught them!  He ate them both!

The story teaches us: Be careful of people who pretend to be good but are not.
