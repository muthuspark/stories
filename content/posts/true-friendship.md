In the jungle of Ajanar, lived two strong lions, Shursingh and Singraj. Shursingh was getting old and couldn't hunt anymore. 

Singraj would hunt for him and bring him food.  When Singraj went hunting, Shursingh was all alone.  The other animals were too scared to go near him.

One day, a pack of jackals saw Shursingh alone.  They thought they found a big meal! They surrounded him and bit him, hurting him badly. Shursingh fainted.

Suddenly, Singraj roared and came running. The jackals were terrified when they saw him! Singraj chased them all away, saving his friend Shursingh's life.

**Lesson:** True friendship always helps!
