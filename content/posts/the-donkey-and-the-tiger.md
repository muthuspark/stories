A long time ago, in a jungle, a donkey and a tiger had a big argument.

The donkey said, "The grass is blue!" 

The tiger said, "No, the grass is green!" 

Their argument got so loud that they decided to ask the jungle king, the lion, to settle it.  They went to see the lion on his throne.

Before the lion could even say anything, the donkey shouted, "Your Majesty, is it true that the grass is blue?"

The lion, wanting to be done with it quickly, said, "Yes, the grass is blue."

The donkey was so happy! He said, "The tiger disagreed with me and annoyed me! Please punish him!" 

The lion said, "The tiger will be punished with five years of silence!" 

The donkey happily went on his way, saying, "The grass is blue! The grass is blue!"

The tiger accepted his punishment, but then he asked the lion, "Your Majesty, why did you punish me? The grass is green!" 

The lion said, "Actually, the grass *is* green."

The tiger asked, "Then why did you punish me?"

The lion explained, "It wasn't about whether the grass is blue or green.  You are a brave and clever tiger! It's not right for you to waste your time arguing with a donkey, and then bother me with such a silly question!" 

The lion continued, "Arguing with someone who is stubborn and doesn't care about the truth is a waste of time.  Some people only care about being right, even if they are wrong.  They don't want to listen to anything else, no matter how much proof you show them.  Sometimes, people are just blinded by their anger and pride."

The tiger listened quietly, hung his head, and went home.
