A little bird lived in a beautiful nest in a mango tree.  She had tiny babies who couldn't fly yet.  The mommy bird worked hard to bring them food every day.

One day, it started to rain very hard. The baby birds got very hungry and started crying loudly.  The mommy bird tried to comfort them, but they were too hungry to stop crying!


The mommy bird worried.  How could she find food in such a strong storm?  After thinking hard, she flew far away to a farmer's house.

She saw some rice and fruit left in the farmer's yard.  Quickly, she picked up lots of rice in her beak and flew back to her nest.

She fed the rice to her babies. Their tummies were full, and they stopped crying and started playing happily.

**Lesson:** A mother's love is the best love in the world!  She will do anything to take care of her babies, even if it's very difficult.
