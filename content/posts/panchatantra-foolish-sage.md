Once upon a time, a wise man named Deva Sharma lived in a temple outside a town.  People loved him and gave him lots of gifts – food, money, and clothes!  Deva sold the gifts he didn't need and became very rich. But he was very, very careful with his money. He always kept it in a bag under his arm.

One day, a sneaky man came to the temple. He saw Deva's money bag and wanted to steal it! He couldn't climb the walls or break in, so he had a clever plan. He decided to pretend to be Deva's student.

He bowed down and said, "Please teach me to be good! I want to find peace." Deva was kind and said, "Of course!" The sneaky man asked to be Deva's student, promising to do anything.

Deva agreed, but said, "I like to be alone at night. You'll sleep in a hut outside the temple."

The sneaky man agreed. He helped Deva all day, but he still couldn't get the money bag. He was getting frustrated! He even thought about hurting Deva!

Then, a boy came to invite Deva to a party. Deva went to the party with his sneaky student.  Near a river, Deva needed to go to the bathroom. He asked his student to watch his robe, where he'd put his money bag.

That was the sneaky man's chance!  He ran away with the money bag!

When Deva came back, the sneaky man was gone, and so was his money! Deva was sad, but he knew not to trust everyone.  He learned that sweet words can hide a sneaky heart!
