Birbal, slightly smaller but with a distinct, wise expression, stands beside him in calming blues and greens.  A worried merchant, depicted in muted browns and greys, kneels before them, recounting his plight.  In the foreground, a line of servants, each holding a similar-sized wooden stick,  are depicted in various muted earth tones with one servant clearly smaller and noticeably fidgeting, highlighted with a darker shadow suggesting guilt. The overall style should be detailed yet whimsical, evoking a classic fairytale atmosphere with warm, inviting colors.](/images/image_the-foolish-thief0.png)


Once upon a time, a rich merchant went to Emperor Akbar's court to ask for help from Birbal.  Someone had stolen some of his things! The merchant suspected one of his many servants, but couldn't figure out who it was.

When he told Emperor Akbar about his problem, Akbar gave the task of solving it to his clever minister, Birbal.

Birbal came up with a clever plan. He called all the merchant's servants together. He gave each servant a stick of the same length and told them, "By tomorrow, the thief's stick will grow two inches longer!" 

The next day, Birbal called the servants back to the court.  He saw that one servant's stick was two inches shorter than the others!

![Watercolor illustration depicting Birbal's clever plan. The focus is on a close-up of the servants' hands holding their sticks, rendered in realistic detail. The sticks are all the same length, except for one which is visibly shorter.  Use a muted color palette, focusing on the contrast between the identical sticks and the slightly shorter, darker stick of the guilty servant.  Emperor Akbar and Birbal are visible in the background, painted in soft, muted tones, to emphasize the focus on the crucial evidence. The background should use light washes of color suggesting a grand court setting. ](/images/image_the-foolish-thief1.png)

Birbal knew he had found the thief! The foolish thief had made his stick shorter because he thought it would magically grow longer.

![A watercolor painting showcasing the triumphant conclusion.  Emperor Akbar, in rich, celebratory colors, gestures approvingly towards Birbal, who smiles serenely in calmer, complimentary tones. The merchant, now relieved and grateful, is shown bowing deeply in softer browns and yellows. The thief is depicted in the background, subdued and smaller, with darker shades emphasizing their guilt. Use a lighter color palette with celebratory touches, such as gold accents on the Emperor's garments, to portray joy and resolution. The overall style should be elegant and expressive, using flowing brushstrokes to convey a sense of justice and happiness.](/images/image_the-foolish-thief2.png)

Birbal cleverly caught the thief! The Emperor praised Birbal, and the merchant was very happy to get his things back. He thanked the Emperor and went home.

**Lesson:** Truth and justice always win!
