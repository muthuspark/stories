![Watercolor painting of the four brown and beige bulls, standing shoulder to shoulder, horns pointed towards the viewer, after defeating the lion. They look proud but relieved, slightly muddied and with leaves clinging to their fur. The orange lion is in the background, defeated and retreating into the lush green jungle. Use a palette of earthy greens, browns, and oranges with a focus on texture and detail in the fur and horns of the bulls. The style should evoke a sense of triumph and friendship.](/images/image_the-lions-trick2.png)


Once upon a time, in a thick jungle, lived four friendly bulls. They were best friends and always stayed together.  A lion lived in the same jungle. He wanted to eat one of the bulls, but he was too scared to attack them all at once. The bulls were big and strong, and their horns were scary!

The lion tried and tried, but he could never catch a bull alone. They always stuck together, helping each other.  One day, the lion had a clever idea. He decided to trick the bulls into fighting each other!

He went to one bull and whispered, "Your friends say you're very silly!"  The bull felt sad and stopped talking to his friends.  The lion did this to each of the bulls, making them angry with each other.

When the bulls were no longer friends, the lion attacked one of them. But the other three bulls saw this and rushed to help! They fought the lion bravely and saved their friend.  One bull said, "We weren't silly to fall for the lion's trick!" 

**Lesson:** We should always trust our friends and not let anyone trick us into fighting with them.
