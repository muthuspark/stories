![A watercolor illustration depicting Somilaka's journey.  Somilaka, with his characteristic features (consistent size, shape, and coloring across the image), is shown walking a winding path.  In the distance,  a city is vaguely visible.  Two shadowy figures representing Destiny and Action are depicted slightly larger than Somilaka, hovering near him, one with a dark hue and the other with lighter tones.  The gold coins, represented as small glittering highlights, should be subtly visible near Somilaka during his initial journey and disappearing later in the illustration, illustrating the theme of the story. The color palette should utilize a warm and serene color scheme with a focus on blues and gold accents.](/images/image_panchatantra-unlucky-weaver1.png)


Once upon a time, there was a cloth weaver named Somilaka. He made beautiful clothes for kings and princes, but he didn't have much money.  Other weavers made not-so-nice clothes, but they were rich!

Somilaka told his wife, "This place isn't good for me! I make the best clothes, but I'm poor. I'm going somewhere else to find better luck."

His wife didn't want him to go, but Somilaka went anyway. He went to a new city and became very successful!  In just three years, he saved 300 gold coins!

He was happy and decided to go home to his wife.  On his way, he heard two voices:

Destiny said, "Somilaka shouldn't have so much gold! He doesn't need that much!" 

Action said, "He worked hard, so he deserves a reward, but we can decide how much."

Somilaka checked his bag â€“ all his gold was gone! He was very sad.  He didn't want to face his wife with no money.

He went back to the city and worked even harder. In one year, he saved 500 gold coins!  He tried to go home again, but the same thing happened! His gold disappeared!

Somilaka was so sad he wanted to give up. He was going to hang himself from a tree!

Just then, he heard a voice from heaven!  It was Destiny!  Destiny said, "I took your gold, because you didn't need it all. But I like how hard you work. You can ask me for anything!" 

Somilaka asked for lots of gold. Destiny said, "You only need enough to live happily. Why do you want more?" 

But Somilaka wanted more! So Destiny said, "Okay, go visit two merchants. Watch how they act, then tell me what you really want."

Somilaka visited a rich merchant who was mean and gave him bad food and a dirty bed. That night, he heard Destiny and Action talk about it.

Then he visited a poor merchant who was very kind. He gave Somilaka nice clothes, good food, and a comfy bed. That night, he heard Destiny and Action talk about that too!  The next morning, Somilaka saw that the kind merchant got rewarded by the king for his kindness.

Somilaka finally understood! He told Destiny, "I only want enough money to be happy, like the kind merchant."

Destiny gave him just enough.  Somilaka went home to his wife and they lived happily ever after.

The end! Remember: work hard, but be happy with what you have!
