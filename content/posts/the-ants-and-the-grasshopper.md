![Watercolor painting of a family of industrious brown ants, consistently sized and shaped, diligently gathering food, sticks, and leaves in a vibrant autumnal forest.  A single, larger green grasshopper, consistent in size and shape throughout the painting, watches them lazily from a sun-drenched patch of grass.  In the background, hints of a snowy winter landscape subtly appear on the horizon, indicating the approaching cold. The overall style should evoke a sense of warmth and impending winter.](/images/image_the-ants-and-the-grasshopper0.png)

A larger, consistently sized and shaped, bright green grasshopper looks on from a nearby sunny rock, his expression one of carefree amusement.  Subtle snowflakes gently fall in the upper corners of the image, suggesting the approaching winter. The color palette should be warm and inviting with cool touches of approaching winter.](/images/image_the-ants-and-the-grasshopper1.png)

The grasshopper's expression should reflect regret and understanding. The background forest shows a clear shift from autumnal warmth to a cold winter scene. The colors should be vivid, highlighting the difference between the ants' preparedness and the grasshopper's plight.](/images/image_the-ants-and-the-grasshopper2.png)


A long time ago, in a big forest, lived a family of ants and a grasshopper.  One day, just before winter, the ants were busy gathering food, sticks, and leaves for the cold months ahead.

The grasshopper watched them from afar. He saw how busy the ants were, but he was just relaxing in the sun.  He hopped over to them and asked, "What are you all doing on such a nice day?"

One of the ants replied, "We're getting ready for winter. You should store some food too!" 

The grasshopper laughed and hopped away. He spent his days chasing butterflies and basking in the sun.

The days went by.  The ants kept working, while the grasshopper just played. 


One morning, the grasshopper woke up to a cold, snowy day.  The ground was covered in ice! He hopped around looking for food, but he couldn't find anything. He had to go hungry that day.  He finally understood that the ants were right!

**Lesson:** Time waits for no one. We should always make the most of our opportunities and prepare for the future.
