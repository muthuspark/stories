![Watercolor painting: A rich man's garden teeming with activity. A half-built temple is the backdrop.  A large wooden log, split apart by a wedge, is the focal point.  Several human workers (consistent size, shape, and warm color palette), are clearly moving away from the scene indicating lunch break. A group of lively monkeys (smaller, consistent size and shape, varying shades of brown) are playfully interacting with the construction tools and the log. One monkey is trapped inside the snapped-shut log. The scene is rendered in a whimsical yet slightly cautionary watercolor style, with bright colors and soft edges.](/images/image_panchatantra-monkey-and-wedge2.png)


A rich man built a big temple in his garden.  Lots of workers, like carpenters and builders, helped.  Every day, they worked hard in the morning, then took a break for lunch, and worked some more in the afternoon.

One day, some playful monkeys came to watch.  One carpenter was cutting a giant log of wood. He was only halfway done, so he put a little wooden piece, called a wedge, in the crack to keep the log open. Then he went to lunch.

When everyone was gone, the monkeys started playing with all the tools. One curious monkey saw the wedge.  He sat on the log, grabbed the wedge, and pulled it out!  

*SNAP!* The log closed shut! The monkey was stuck!  He got hurt because he shouldn't have touched something that wasn't his.

This is a good lesson: It's not good to mess with things that aren't yours!  It's better to mind your own business.
