![A watercolor painting of a sad scene: A dead donkey lies in a field, the tiger skin discarded nearby. Shuddapatta stands over it, looking down with remorse. The farmers are visible in the background, their figures less prominent, suggesting the aftermath of the chase. The overall color palette is subdued, with browns, greys, and muted greens dominating.  The focus should be on the donkey's lifeless form and Shuddapatta's grief, emphasizing the story's moral.](/images/image_panchatantra-donkey-and-washerman2.png)


Shuddapatta was a washerman who had a donkey.  But he didn't take good care of his donkey!  The donkey was skinny and weak because there wasn't much food around.

One day, Shuddapatta found a dead tiger in the jungle! He had a clever idea. He skinned the tiger and put the skin on his donkey.

"Now," he thought, "my donkey will look like a tiger!  The farmers will be too scared to stop him from eating all the yummy barley in their fields!" 

So, every night, Shuddapatta put the tiger skin on his donkey. The donkey ate lots of barley, and the farmers stayed far away!

The donkey got healthy and strong again. But one night, while he was eating, he heard another donkey!  He brayed back, and the farmers heard him.  They realized it was just a donkey wearing a tiger skin!

They chased the donkey and, sadly, the donkey didn't make it.  It's important to always be yourself!
