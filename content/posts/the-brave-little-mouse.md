A long time ago, in a small village, lived a tiny mouse named Jerry. Jerry was small, but he had a big heart and was very brave.  Even though he was little, he always dreamed of going on adventures and showing everyone how courageous he was.

One day, a scary cat came to the village! All the animals were so scared they wouldn't even leave their homes to find food.  The village was running out of food, and Jerry knew he had to do something to save his friends and home.

Jerry came up with a plan to defeat the cat and went on an adventure all by himself! He found a shiny bell and tied it to his tail. Then, while the cat was sleeping, he snuck into the cat's house and rang the bell loudly! The cat woke up with a start, chased the sound, and ran far away from the village!

Because of Jerry's bravery, the village was safe again. The other animals were amazed by Jerry's courage and thanked him for saving their homes. From that day on, Jerry was known as the bravest mouse in the village!

**Lesson:** Even the smallest creature can make a big difference if they have courage and determination!
