A mean-looking hunter (dark, earthy tones) is shown under the tree, shivering, next to a cage containing a dove (soft pink). Another dove (same pink, similar shape) is approaching the hunter, offering burning leaves.  The background shows a stormy sky with rain. The doves have gentle, compassionate expressions, while the hunter shows remorse.  Use soft, blending watercolor techniques for a dreamlike quality.](/images/image_panchatantra-dove-and-hunter1.png)

A mean hunter lived in the jungle. He was so mean that everyone left him.  He hunted birds and other small animals.

In the same jungle, two doves lived happily in a nest high in a big tree.

One day, the hunter caught the mama dove! He put her in a cage.  Then, a big storm came!  The hunter was scared and needed a place to hide.

He found the big tree where the doves lived!  He hid under it to get out of the rain and wind.  He was cold and hungry.

The papa dove was worried because his wife wasn't home.  The storm made him even more worried.

The mama dove called to her husband from her cage.  She told him, "The hunter is under our tree. Be kind to him, even though he caught me.  It's important to help others who need it."

The papa dove was kind and good. He flew down and greeted the hunter warmly, "Welcome! Please stay here as long as you need."

The hunter was cold and the papa dove brought him some burning leaves to keep warm. But the hunter was still hungry.  The papa dove said, "I'll help you, please eat me!"  He flew into the fire to help the hunter.

The hunter felt very sorry. He was sad for what he did and for the kind dove who helped him. He let the mama dove out of the cage.

Mama dove was so sad that her husband was gone. She flew into the fire too.

In heaven, they became beautiful, shining creatures!  The hunter became a good person and helped others. He was happy in the end.

This story shows us that kindness and helping others are very important.
