Prince Majnun, a fair-skinned boy with bright red hair, rosy lips, and sparkly blue eyes, and his friend Husain Mahamat, are gleefully slicing mangoes and papayas with toy knives beneath a sprawling, ancient mango tree whose gnarled branches cast dappled shadows. Colorful flowers like hibiscus, bougainvillea, and jasmine bloom riotously around them, their vibrant hues popping against the emerald green grass. Sun filters through the leaves, creating pools of light and illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The air is thick with the sweet scent of blossoms and ripe fruit.

Once upon a time, there was a king named King Dantal. He had lots and lots of money, soldiers, and horses! He also had a son, Prince Majnun. Prince Majnun was a very cute boy with a bright smile, rosy lips, sparkly blue eyes, super red cheeks, bright red hair, and fair skin. He loved playing with his best friend, Husain Mahamat, who was the son of the King's helper. They would play in King Dantal's amazing garden, which was huge and filled with yummy fruits, pretty flowers, and big, shady trees. They would take their little toy knives to cut the fruits and munch on them. King Dantal even hired a teacher to teach them how to read and write.


As they grew up, they became two awesome young men. One day, Prince Majnun told his dad, "Husain Mahamat and I want to go on a fun hunting trip!" His dad said, "Okay, you can go!" So, they got their horses ready and packed everything they needed. They rode to a place called Phalana, hunting along the way. But they only found little animals like jackals and birds.

The sky is painted in hues of dusty rose and pale orange. They are dressed in practical hunting attire of muted greens and browns, leather jerkins, and turbans, carrying polished wooden bows and feathered arrows. A few scrawny jackals and soaring vultures are visible in the distance, silhouetted against the rising sun. The parched earth is cracked and dry, with sparse vegetation. Details: Dust swirling around the horses' hooves, the boys' determined expressions, the wind whipping through their hair, the glint of sunlight on the arrowheads. A sense of vastness and vulnerability. A muted, earthy color palette with pops of dawn colors. Natural watercolor flow conveying the dry heat.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail1.png)

The ruler of Phalana was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili. She was super beautiful with warm brown eyes and shiny black hair. 

One night, before Prince Majnun ever came to Phalana, Laili was asleep when she had a dream. In her dream, a friendly angel came to her and said she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else. The angel said it was a message from up above! When Laili woke up, she told her dad about her dream, but he didn't listen. From that day on, she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!" She wouldn't say anything else! Even when she was eating, she would say, "Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!" Her dad got really annoyed. "Who is this Majnun?" he would ask. "I've never even heard of him!" Laili would say, "He's the one I'm going to marry! It's a message from up above!" She was almost a little bit crazy about it! Meanwhile, Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat were hunting in Phalana. One day, Laili was riding her horse, enjoying the fresh air, and she rode right behind them! She kept calling out, "Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!" The prince heard her and turned around. "Who's calling my name?" he asked. Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him, she fell head-over-heels in love! She thought to herself, "That's him! That's Prince Majnun! The one I'm supposed to marry!" She went home and told her dad, "Dad, I want to marry that prince who came to our land. He's the one! He's Prince Majnun!" Munsuk Raja said, "Okay, you can marry him. We'll ask him tomorrow." Laili tried to be patient, but she was so excited! But that very night, the prince left Phalana! When Laili heard he was gone, she went completely bonkers! She wouldn't listen to her dad, her mom, or the servants. She ran off into the jungle and wandered around for twelve whole years! All that time, she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!"

![Watercolor illustration of Laili, a beautiful princess with warm brown eyes and shiny black hair cascading down her back, riding her spirited white horse bareback through the open fields of Phalana. The sun is high in the sky, casting long shadows. She calls out, 'Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!' her voice echoing across the landscape. Prince Majnun, with a surprised and slightly startled expression, turns his head towards her, his bright red hair catching the sunlight. Husain Mahamat is beside him, looking curious and perhaps a little protective. Details: Laili's flowing white dress, the horse's muscular build, the swaying grass underfoot, the distant mountains. A sense of longing and anticipation. A vibrant color palette with emphasis on blues, greens, and whites. The watercolor rendering evokes a sense of movement and freedom.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail2.png)

After twelve years, she met a kind helper. He was actually an angel, but she didn't know that! The helper asked her, "Why do you keep saying, 'Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!'?" She told him, "I'm the princess of Phalana, and I'm trying to find Prince Majnun! Can you tell me where he lives?" The helper said, "Oh, I don't think you'll ever get there. It's really far away, and you have to cross lots of rivers." But Laili didn't care. She had to find Prince Majnun! The helper said, "Well, when you get to the Bhagirathi River, you'll see a big fish, a Rohu. You have to ask him to give you a ride to Prince Majnun's country, or you'll never make it." 

She walked and walked until she finally got to the Bhagirathi River. There was a huge fish called the Rohu. He was yawning as she came up to him, and she jumped right down his throat and into his tummy! All that time, she kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun!" The Rohu fish got really scared and swam down the river as fast as he could. After a while, he got tired and slowed down. A crow landed on his back and said, "Caw, caw!" The poor fish said, "Oh, Mr. Crow, can you see what's in my tummy making all that noise?" The crow said, "Okay, open your mouth, and I'll fly down and take a peek." So, the Rohu opened his mouth, and the crow flew down. But he came up really fast! "You have a scary monster in your tummy!" the crow said, and he flew away. The Rohu was very worried. He swam on and on until he got to Prince Majnun's country. Then he stopped. A jackal came down to the river to get a drink. The Rohu said, "Oh, Jackal, can you tell me what's inside me?" The jackal said, "How can I tell? I can't see unless I go inside you." So, the Rohu opened his mouth, and the jackal jumped down his throat. But he came up really fast, looking super scared! "You have a monster in your tummy!" he said. "If I don't run away, it's going to eat me!" And he ran off. Then came a really big snake. The fish said, "Oh, please tell me what's in my tummy. It's making so much noise and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!'" The snake said, "Open your mouth, and I'll go down and see." The snake went down and came back up. He said, "You have a monster in your tummy. But if you let me cut you open, it'll come out." The Rohu said, "But if you do that, I'll die!" The snake said, "Oh no, you won't! I'll give you medicine that will make you all better." So, the fish agreed. The snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili!

She was very old now. She had spent twelve years wandering in the jungle and twelve years living inside the Rohu fish. She wasn't beautiful anymore, and she had lost her teeth. The snake put her on his back and carried her into the country. Then he put her down, and she walked and walked until she got to Prince Majnun's place, where he was sitting. Some people heard her crying, "Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!" They asked her what she wanted. "I want King Majnun!" she said. So, they went inside and told Prince Majnun, "There's an old woman outside who wants to see you." He said, "I can't leave. Tell her to come in." They brought her in, and the prince asked her what she wanted. "I want to marry you!" she said. "Twenty-four years ago, you came to my dad's place, Phalana, and I wanted to marry you then. But you left without marrying me! Then I went a little crazy and wandered around all these years looking for you." Prince Majnun said, "Okay." Laili said, "Let's ask up above to make us young again, and then we can get married!" So, the prince prayed, and the message came that he should touch Laili's clothes. They would catch fire, and she and he would become young again! He touched her clothes, and they burst into flames! Suddenly, she and he were young again! They had a big party, got married, and went to Phalana to see her mom and dad. 

Laili's mom and dad had cried so much for her that they couldn't see anymore. They were blind. Her dad kept saying, "Laili, Laili, Laili!" When Laili saw them, she asked up above to make them able to see again, and that's exactly what happened! As soon as her mom and dad saw her, they hugged and kissed her. Then they had another wedding party with lots of fun! Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years. Then they went back to King Dantal and lived happily ever after.

They would go hunting and travel to different places to have fun. 

One day, Prince Majnun said to Laili, "Let's go through this jungle!" Laili said, "No, no! If we go through this jungle, something bad will happen!" But Prince Majnun laughed and went into the jungle anyway. While they were walking, up above wondered, "I wonder how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be really sad if she went away? Would he marry someone else? Let's see!" So, up above sent an angel disguised as a kind helper into the jungle. The angel came up to Laili and threw some magical dust in her face. In a blink, she turned into a little pile of ashes!

Prince Majnun was so sad when he saw his dear Laili turn into ashes. He went straight home to his dad and was super sad for a long, long time. After many years, he started to feel better and went back to his dad's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wanted his son to get married again. Prince Majnun said, "I only want Laili! I won't marry anyone else!" His dad said, "How can you marry Laili? She's gone! She's not coming back!" Prince Majnun said, "Then I won't get married at all!"

Meanwhile, Laili was still in the jungle where her husband had left her, a little pile of ashes. As soon as Majnun left, the helper had taken her ashes and cleaned them up. Then he mixed clay and water with the ashes and made a woman-shaped figure. Then, just like that, Laili got her body back, and up above gave her life again! But Laili was an old woman again, with a long, long nose and pointy teeth! She was just like she was when she came out of the Rohu fish! She lived in the jungle and didn't eat or drink. She just kept saying, "Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!"

![Watercolor illustration of Laili as an old woman, with a long, hooked nose, receding gums revealing pointy teeth, and wild, matted grey hair, standing in a dark and overgrown jungle clearing at dusk. She is thin and ragged, her clothes torn and stained with mud, looking utterly forlorn and desperate. She is crying out, "Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!" her voice raspy and weak. The jungle is dense and menacing, with tangled vines and shadowy trees. Details: Her skeletal hands outstretched, the dirt caked under her fingernails, the hollows of her cheeks, the glint of madness in her eyes, the rustling of unseen creatures in the undergrowth. A sense of decay and despair. A dark and somber color palette with muted greens, browns, and greys. The watercolor bleeds and blurs to create an atmosphere of unease.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail3.png)

Finally, the angel who had been the helper and threw the magical dust at her asked up above, "What's the point of this woman sitting in the jungle, crying and crying forever, 'Majnun, Majnun! I want Majnun!' and not eating or drinking anything? Can I take her to Prince Majnun?" Up above said, "Okay, you can. But tell her she can't talk to Majnun if he's scared of her when he sees her. If he's scared, she'll turn into a little white dog the next day. Then she has to go to the palace. She'll only get her human shape back when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed." So, the angel came to Laili again as a helper and took her to King Dantal's garden. He said, "Now, it's a message that you stay here until Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden. Then you can show yourself to him. But you can't talk to him if he's scared of you. If he's scared, you'll become a little white dog tomorrow." Then he told her what she had to do as a little dog to get her human form back.

Laili stayed in the garden, hiding in the tall grass, until Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came for a walk. King Dantal was a very old man now, and Husain Mahamat looked much older than Prince Majnun, who had been made young again when he got married to Laili. 

As Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat walked in the garden, they picked fruit like they did when they were little. They bit the fruit with their teeth. While Majnun was eating and talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned around and saw Laili walking behind them. "Oh, look!" he shouted. "See what's following you! It's a scary monster! It's going to eat us!" Laili looked at him with all her eyes, begging him. She trembled with old age and excitement, but that only scared Majnun more! "It's a monster!" he shouted. He ran to the palace with Husain Mahamat, and Laili disappeared into the jungle. They told King Dantal that there was a monster in the garden that was going to eat them. "That's silly!" his dad said. "Two grown men being scared by an old lady? If it was a monster, it would have eaten you!" King Dantal didn't believe Majnun until Husain Mahamat said the prince was telling the truth. They searched the garden for the old woman but didn't find anything. King Dantal told his son he was being silly. But Prince Majnun wouldn't walk in the garden anymore. 

![Watercolor illustration of Prince Majnun walking in a manicured garden, recoiling in fear and disgust as he sees an old woman (Laili), with a long, hooked nose and receding gums revealing pointy teeth, approaching him with outstretched hands. The garden is bursting with colorful blooms, but the scene is tense. Husain Mahamat stands behind him, equally startled and wary, his hand instinctively reaching for his sword. The sun is shining brightly, highlighting the contrast between the garden's beauty and the woman's horrifying appearance. Details: Majnun's wide eyes and trembling hands, Husain Mahamat's protective stance, the woman's desperate expression, the shadows cast by the approaching figure, the carefully manicured hedges. A sense of shock and revulsion. A vibrant color palette contrasted with the harshness of the old woman's depiction. The watercolor is used to emphasize the stark contrast between beauty and decay.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail5.png)

The next day, Laili turned into a pretty little dog! She came into the palace, and Prince Majnun really liked her! She followed him everywhere, went hunting with him, and helped him catch animals. Prince Majnun fed her milk, bread, or anything he was eating. At night, the little dog slept in his bed.

![Watercolor illustration of Prince Majnun asleep in his canopied bed at night. The bed is adorned with silk sheets and embroidered cushions. A small, fluffy white dog (Laili), with soulful eyes, is curled up contentedly beside him, her head resting on his arm. Moonlight streams in through the tall, arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long, soft shadows across the wooden floor. Details: A book lying open on the bedside table, a flickering candle casting a warm glow, the intricate carvings on the bed frame, the dog's gentle breathing, the peaceful expression on Majnun's face. A sense of tranquility and vulnerability. A soft, cool color palette with blues, silvers, and whites. The watercolor is smooth and delicate, creating a dreamlike quality.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail4.png)

But one night, the little dog was gone! Instead, there was the old woman who had scared him in the garden! Now Prince Majnun was sure she was a monster who had come to eat him. He cried out, "What do you want? Please don't eat me!" Poor Laili said, "Don't you know me? I'm your wife, Laili, and I want to marry you! Don't you remember how you wanted to go through that jungle, even though I begged you not to? I told you something bad would happen! Then a helper came and threw dust in my face, and I turned into ashes. But up above gave me my life back and brought me here. I had to stay in the jungle for a long time, crying for you. Now I have to be a little dog. But if you marry me, I won't be a little dog anymore!" Majnun said, "How can I marry an old woman like you? How can you be Laili? You're a monster!" He was very scared. 

In the morning, the old woman had turned into the little dog. The prince told his dad everything. "An old woman! An old woman! Always an old woman!" said his dad. "You only think about old women. How can a strong man like you be so easily scared?" But when he saw that his son was really scared and believed the old woman would come back at night, he told him to say, "I'll marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry an old woman like you?"

That night, as he lay shaking in bed, the little old woman was there instead of the dog. She was crying, "Majnun, Majnun! I want to marry you! I've loved you all these years! When I was a young girl, I knew about you, even though you didn't know about me. We should have been married then if you hadn't left so suddenly! For many, many years, I followed you!" Majnun said, "Okay, if you can make yourself a young girl again, I'll marry you."

Laili said, "That's easy! Up above will make me a young girl again. In two days, you have to go into the garden. You'll see a beautiful fruit. Pick it, bring it to your room, and cut it open gently. Don't open it when your dad or anyone else is with you. Do it when you're all alone. I'll be in the fruit with no clothes on!" In the morning, Laili took her little dog form and disappeared into the garden.

Prince Majnun told his dad everything. His dad told him to do what the old woman had said. In two days, he and Husain Mahamat walked in the garden and saw a large, lovely red fruit. The Prince said, "I wonder if I'll find my wife in that fruit." Husain Mahamat wanted him to pick it and see, but he said he wanted to tell his dad first. His dad said, "That must be the fruit. Go and pick it!" So, Majnun went back and picked the fruit. He said to his dad, "Come with me to my room while I open it. I'm scared to open it alone. Maybe there's a monster in it that will eat me!" King Dantal said, "No! Remember, Laili will be naked. You have to go alone. Don't be scared if there's a monster. I'll stay outside the door. You can just shout, and I'll come help you. The monster won't be able to eat you."

Then Majnun took the fruit and started cutting it open, shaking with fear. When he cut it open, out stepped Laili! She was young and more beautiful than ever! When Majnun saw how beautiful she was, he fainted and fell on the floor!

![Watercolor illustration of Prince Majnun carefully cutting open a large, vibrant red pomegranate in his opulent room at night. He is shaking with fear, his eyes wide with apprehension. The room is dimly lit by flickering candlelight, casting eerie shadows on the walls and highlighting the ornate details of the furnishings. Details: A silver tray holding a jeweled dagger, the juice dripping from the fruit, the trembling of Majnun's hands, the shadows dancing on the walls, the flickering candlelight reflecting in his eyes, rich tapestry hanging from the wall. A sense of foreboding and dread. A dark and moody color palette with deep reds, blacks, and golds. The watercolor is used to create a sense of depth and atmosphere.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail6.png)

Laili took off his hat and wrapped it around herself like a dress, because she didn't have any clothes on. Then she called King Dantal and said sadly, "Why is Majnun on the floor? Why won't he talk to me? He wasn't scared of me before. He's seen me lots of times!" King Dantal said, "It's because you're so beautiful! You're much more beautiful than before. He'll be happy soon." Then the King got some water and washed Majnun's face. He gave him some to drink, and Majnun sat up. Laili said, "Why did you faint? Didn't you see it was me? I'm Laili!" Prince Majnun said, "I see you're Laili, but your eyes are so beautiful that I fainted when I saw them!" Then they were all very happy. King Dantal had all the drums beaten and all the musical instruments played. They had a big wedding party, gave presents to the servants, and gave lots of money to everyone.

After some time, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to enjoy the fresh air. They rode on the same horse and only had one helper with them. They came to a beautiful garden in another kingdom. Majnun said, "We have to go into that garden and see it!" Laili said, "No, no! It belongs to a bad ruler, Chumman Basa. He's very mean!" But Majnun said he wanted to go in. Despite what Laili said, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them. She knew he wanted to hurt her husband and take her away! She said to Majnun, "Let's go! Don't go near that man. I can see in his eyes that he wants to hurt you!" Majnun said, "That's silly. I think he's a good ruler. I can't get away. I'm too close to him!" Laili said, "It's better if you get hurt than me. I can't come back to life again. I can bring you back to life if you get hurt!" Chumman Basa came close and seemed friendly. But when he was talking to Majnun, he pulled out his sword and cut off the prince's head in one swing!

![Watercolor illustration of Laili and Prince Majnun riding on a powerful, dark horse through a lush, green landscape at twilight. The sky is painted with dramatic hues of orange, purple, and pink. Chumman Basa, a hulking figure with a sinister look on his face and a cruel smile, approaches them from the shadows, blocking their path. Laili appears worried and is trying to pull Prince Majnun away, her hand gripping his arm tightly. Details: The fear in Laili's eyes, the determination in Chumman Basa's gaze, the darkening sky, the horse's labored breathing, the long shadows stretching across the ground. A sense of impending danger and betrayal. A dramatic color palette with bold contrasts. The watercolor is used to emphasize the tension and drama of the scene.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail7.png)

Laili sat still on her horse. As the ruler came towards her, she said, "Why did you do that?" He said, "I want to take you!" Laili said, "You can't!" The ruler said, "Yes, I can!" Laili said, "Okay, then, take me!" So, he came close and reached out to take her hand and help her off the horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, as long as her hand was wide! The knife got really long right away! Laili swung her arm and the long knife, and the ruler's head came off!

![Watercolor illustration depicting Laili, standing over the beheaded body of Chumman Basa, with a bloody, oversized scimitar in her hand. Blood splatters the ground and her clothes. Majnun's lifeless body lies nearby, his face serene. She has a determined and almost vacant expression, her eyes fixed on some distant point. The scene is bathed in the harsh light of the setting sun. Details: The bloodstained scimitar, the vacant look in Laili's eyes, the peaceful expression on Majnun's face, the twisted limbs of Chumman Basa, the shadows lengthening across the landscape. A sense of tragic justice and utter despair. A muted color palette with stark contrasts and splashes of red. The watercolor is used to create a sense of shock and horror.](/images/image_fairy-tales-loving-lail8.png)

Laili got off her horse and went to Majnun's body. She made a cut on her finger from the top of her nail down to her hand, and blood came out like healing medicine. She put Majnun's head back on and smeared the blood all over the wound. Majnun woke up and said, "I had a good sleep! I feel like I slept for years!" Then he got up and saw the ruler's body by Laili's horse. He said, "What's that?" Laili said, "That's the mean ruler who hurt you so he could take me. I told you so!" Majnun said, "Who hurt him?" Laili said, "I did! And I'm the one who brought you back to life!" Majnun said, "Bring the poor man back to life if you can." Laili said, "No, he's mean and will try to hurt you again." But Majnun begged her to bring the ruler back to life. At last, she said, "Get on the horse and go far away with the helper." Majnun said, "What will you do if I leave you? I can't leave you!" Laili said, "I'll be careful. But this man is so mean, he might hurt you again if you're near him!" So, Majnun got on the horse, and he and the helper went far away to wait for Laili. Then she put the ruler's head back on and squeezed her finger until a little bit of healing blood came out. She smeared it on the wound. As she saw the ruler opening his eyes, she ran so fast that she ran faster than the ruler, who was trying to catch her! She jumped on the horse behind her husband, and they rode so fast until they got to King Dantal's palace!

Prince Majnun told his dad everything. His dad was shocked and angry. He said, "You're lucky to have such a wife. Why didn't you listen to her? You would be gone now!" Then he had a big party to celebrate his son's safety and gave money to everyone. He loved Laili and couldn't do enough for her. Then he built a fancy palace for her and his son, with lots of land, pretty gardens, and lots of helpers to take care of them. But he wouldn't let anyone but their helpers go into their gardens and palace. He wouldn't let Majnun or Laili leave. King Dantal said, "Laili is so beautiful that someone might try to hurt my son to take her away!"
