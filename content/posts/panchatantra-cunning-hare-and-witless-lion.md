Once upon a time, a big, mean lion named Bhasuraka ruled the jungle. He was very scary and killed lots of animals!  

One day, all the animals went to Bhasuraka and said, "Please, Mr. Lion! You kill too many of us.  Just one animal a day is enough for you to eat. Let's make a deal: we'll give you one animal each day, and you won't hunt anymore." 

Bhasuraka agreed, but warned, "If I don't get an animal every day, I'll kill you all!" 

The animals picked one animal each day by drawing straws.  Everyone felt safe, except for the animal chosen that day. 

One day, a little hare was picked.  He didn't want to be eaten! He walked super slowly to the lion's den. 

On the way, he saw a deep well.  He looked inside and saw his own reflection.  He had a great idea!  

"I'll trick the lion!" he thought.  He walked even slower. 

Finally, he got to the den.  Bhasuraka was very hungry and angry! He waited all day for his meal. 

He was ready to eat the hare and then all the other animals.  But the hare bowed and said, "Mr. Lion, please listen!" 

"Hurry up!" roared the lion.  

"I was supposed to be your meal," said the hare, "but I'm too small!  Four other hares came with me, but..." 

"But what?" growled Bhasuraka. 

"...on the way, we met another lion! He said HE was the king of the jungle! He wanted us all. He said, 'Fight me! Whoever is stronger is the king!'"

"What?!" roared Bhasuraka.  "Take me to him!" 

The hare said, "He's in a very strong den.  He's very strong!" 

But Bhasuraka was so angry, he didn't listen.  The hare led him to the well.

"The other lion is in there!" said the hare, pointing to the well. 

Bhasuraka looked into the well.  He saw his own reflection! He thought it was the other lion.  

He roared at his reflection!  The roar bounced back from the well.  

Bhasuraka was so mad, he jumped into the well to fight his reflection!  He fell in and drowned!

The hare was so happy!  He ran back to the other animals, who cheered and celebrated his cleverness.  They all lived happily ever after in the jungle!
