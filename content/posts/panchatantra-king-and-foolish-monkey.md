![A whimsical watercolor painting depicting a king in regal attire, painted in shades of deep red and gold, napping on a luxurious bed. Perched near him is a small, expressive monkey, its fur rendered in warm browns and tans, holding a tiny, decorative sword. Its facial expression is a mix of concern and mischief. A small, almost translucent fly is subtly present near the kingâ€™s face. The background is simple, using soft washes of muted greens and blues to emphasize the figures in the foreground. The style should be loose and expressive, utilizing the fluidity of watercolor to convey movement and emotion.](/images/image_panchatantra-king-and-foolish-monkey2.png)


Once upon a time, there was a king who had a pet monkey.  The monkey was silly, but the king loved him! The monkey could go anywhere in the palace, even the king's private rooms! 

One day, the king was taking a nap, and the monkey was watching over him.  A fly landed on the king's tummy!  The monkey tried to shoo it away, but the fly kept coming back. 

The silly monkey got mad! He grabbed a sword and tried to swat the fly.  He swung the sword so hard, he accidentally hurt the king! The fly flew away, but the king needed help. 

This is why it's important to be careful who you choose as your friends.  Sometimes, a silly friend can cause more trouble than an enemy!
