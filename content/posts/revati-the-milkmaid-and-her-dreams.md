title: "Revati the Milkmaid and Her Dreams"
---

Once upon a time, in a small village, lived a milkmaid named Revati.  She sold milk from her cows to earn money. This money helped her family. 

One day, Revati collected milk from her cows. She filled two buckets and set off to the market to sell it.  

![Watercolor painting of a young milkmaid, Revati, with warm brown skin and dark hair tied back, wearing a simple blue dress.  She's walking down a dirt path, her two buckets of milk are shown partially tipped over, spilling white milk onto the path and her feet.  Revati's face shows a mix of shock and sadness, tears in her eyes. In the background, use soft, muted greens and browns to depict a small village with simple houses.  Maintain a consistent style and color palette throughout the image, emphasizing the watercolor texture.  The style should evoke a nostalgic, slightly melancholic feeling.](/images/image_revati-the-milkmaid-and-her-dreams0.png)

As she walked, she started daydreaming! She thought about all the things she could buy with the money she would earn. 

She imagined buying chickens and selling their eggs. Then, with that money, she’d buy a cake, a basket of strawberries, a fancy dress, and even a new house! She made big plans to become rich quickly. 

She was so excited about her dreams that she forgot all about the buckets of milk she was carrying!  She started spilling the milk without even realizing it.

Suddenly, she felt something wet on her feet.  She looked down and saw that her buckets were completely empty! All the milk was gone!  Revati started to cry. She was very sad because she had been so careless. 

![Watercolor painting in a soft, whimsical style. Focus on a close-up of Revati's face, showing a range of emotions from initial excitement to eventual disappointment.  She has light skin and flowing auburn hair, and wears a simple yellow dress.  One overflowing bucket of milk sits on the ground near her feet, spilling milk that blends subtly with the surrounding earth tones.  Include faint background elements – a few distant houses and trees painted with translucent washes of color – to hint at the village. The watercolor style should emphasize softness and the gradual transitions of color and tone, focusing on the emotion on Revati's face.](/images/image_revati-the-milkmaid-and-her-dreams20.png)

**Lesson:**  Dreams are wonderful, but we need to work hard to make them come true. It's important to focus on the present and work hard before we plan for the future.
