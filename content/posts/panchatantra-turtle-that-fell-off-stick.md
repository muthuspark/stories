Once upon a time, there was a turtle named Kambugriva who lived in a lake.  She had two swan friends! 

Every day, the turtle and the swans would meet by the lake and chat. They loved spending time together.

One day, the lake started to dry up because it didn't rain. The swans were worried.  "Kambugriva," they said, "the lake will be all gone! You won't have anywhere to live!" 

Kambugriva knew they were right.  "My friends," she said, "please find another lake with lots of water. And find a strong stick!" 

The swans flew far away and found a new lake.  They came back and said, "We found it! But Kambugriva, you MUST keep your mouth shut the whole time we carry you.  If you talk, you'll fall!" 

The swans held the stick, and Kambugriva held onto it with her mouth.  They started to fly!

Soon, they flew over a town.  People pointed and shouted, "Look! Swans carrying a turtle!" 

Kambugriva was so excited, she opened her mouth to ask, "What's all the fuss?"

The background features a bustling town with tiny, colorful houses visible below.  The focus is on the moment of Kambugriva's fall, capturing a sense of movement and slight panic. The colors are soft and slightly muted, characteristic of watercolor.](/images/image_panchatantra-turtle-that-fell-off-stick1.png)

WHOOSH! She fell down! The people caught her, sadly. 

The wise old turtles always say: Listen to your friends! They know what's best.
