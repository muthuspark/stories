title: "The Proud Elephant and the Tiny Ants"
---

A long, long time ago, in a big forest, lived a very proud elephant. He was so big and strong that he often bullied the smaller animals.  All the little animals were scared of him.

![Watercolor illustration depicting a scene with a proud, grey elephant (consistent color and size throughout) splashing water onto an anthill.  Several tiny, brown ants (consistent color and size) are shown looking distressed and huddled together near their damaged anthill. The background should be a vibrant green forest, with soft watercolor washes creating depth.  Focus on the emotional contrast between the elephant’s aggressive posture and the ants' vulnerability. Use a detailed style to showcase the intricate nature of the anthill and the ants' expressions, but keep the elephant's features simplified and bold to highlight its size.](/images/image_the-proud-elephant-and-the-tiny-ants1.png)

One day, he went near an anthill and splashed water all over the ants' home. The tiny ants cried because they were so small and couldn't do anything to stop him.  The elephant laughed and threatened to crush them!

The ants sadly went back to their home.  But they were clever! They held a meeting and decided to teach the elephant a lesson.  They waited patiently.

The next day, the elephant came back and put his trunk down to splash water again.  That's when the ants, following their plan, quickly climbed inside his trunk and started to bite him!

The elephant’s expression should portray pain and regret. The background shows a peaceful forest, again using softer watercolor tones, creating a gentle yet impactful contrast with the central scene. Use varying water saturation levels to create depth; for example, the forest background could be slightly more washed out compared to the detailed illustration of the elephant and ants. The overall mood should reflect the resolution of the story – peaceful reconciliation.](/images/image_the-proud-elephant-and-the-tiny-ants2.png)

The elephant cried out in pain! The tiny ants were too small for him to catch, and he couldn't get them out of his trunk. He was stuck!

The elephant finally understood he had been wrong. He felt very sorry for what he had done and apologized to the ants and all the other animals he had bullied.

The ants, seeing how sorry he was, felt pity and crawled out of his trunk. 

**The End**

**Lesson:** We should never bully those who are smaller or weaker than us. We should always be kind and help others.  If we are mean, even the strongest can learn a lesson!
