A lion, with a golden mane and muscular body, is walking away in the background. A leopard with dark spots and a tiger with orange and black stripes are also visible, both looking fearful and running away from the elephant.

Maha should be the focal point, slightly larger than the other animals.](/images/image_panchatantra-jackals-strategy0.png)


Once upon a time, in a big jungle, lived a clever jackal named Maha.  One day, Maha found a dead elephant!  He was so happy because it meant lots of yummy food for many days. But the elephant's skin was super thick and Maha couldn't tear it open!

He tried and tried, but he couldn't even scratch it. Then, he saw a lion walking by.  Maha quickly bowed and said, "Great King Lion! I found this elephant and I'm guarding it for you!"  The lion said, "I only eat animals I catch myself. You can have the elephant."  The lion left.

Maha was still stuck!  Then, a leopard came along. Maha pretended to be brave and said, "Uncle Leopard! This elephant is dangerous! The lion killed it and told me to watch it.  The lion will be back soon!"  The leopard was scared and ran away!

Next, a tiger came. Maha said, "Tiger! You look hungry! This elephant is all yours. I'll watch for the lion!" The tiger happily started eating and ripping the elephant's skin.  Maha shouted, "The lion's coming! Run!"  The tiger ran away.

Finally, Maha had a hole in the elephant's skin! Just as he was about to eat, another jackal arrived! Maha fought the other jackal and sent him away.  At last, Maha got to enjoy his big elephant feast!  The end!
