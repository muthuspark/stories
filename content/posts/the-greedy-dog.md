title: "The Greedy Dog"
---

![Watercolor painting in a whimsical style depicting a hungry, light brown dog with oversized, expressive eyes. The dog is depicted three times: 1) sniffing out a glistening, large bone in a field of bright, loose watercolor washes of green and yellow, 2) facing a river with a clear reflection of itself holding the same bone, 3) sadly sitting by a now cloudy, dark-blueish river, the bone lost.  The dog should be consistently drawn, with the same size and color throughout, emphasizing its emotions through its eyes and body language. Use soft, translucent watercolor techniques to create a dreamy, slightly melancholic mood.](/images/image_the-greedy-dog2.png)


Once upon a time, there was a very hungry dog. He was looking for food everywhere.

While searching, he found a big, juicy bone! He quickly grabbed it in his mouth and started walking home.

On his way home, he had to cross a river.  When he got to the river, he saw his reflection in the water.

The dog thought, "Look! Another dog with a bone! I should grab that one too!"

He opened his mouth to try and bite the other dog (which was just his reflection), and *splash*! His bone fell into the river and sank. The water got cloudy, and his reflection disappeared.

The dog understood what happened. He was sad because he lost his bone. He went home and slept hungry that night.

**Lesson:** Greediness makes us lose what we already have.  It's important to be happy with what we have!
