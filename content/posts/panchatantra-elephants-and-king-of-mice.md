![Watercolor painting of a whimsical scene: a crumbling, earth-toned village with broken houses, tiny brown mice scurrying around, large grey elephants walking carefully along a different path towards a serene blue lake.  The mouse king, slightly larger than the other mice but still tiny, is shown talking to a large elephant king, who looks kindly down at him.  The background features soft blues and greens reflecting the lake and surrounding landscape.

A long, long time ago, a big earthquake shook a village!  The houses fell down, and everyone moved away.  

But guess what?  Lots and lots of tiny mice moved into the broken houses. They made it their new home! 

Nearby was a lake.  Big, big elephants went to the lake every day for a drink and a bath.  To get to the lake, they walked right through the old village where the mice lived.  

Oops!  The elephants were so big, they accidentally stepped on lots of mice!  

The mouse king decided to do something. He went to talk to the elephant king.  "Please," he squeaked, "your herd is hurting my people. Could you please walk a different way to the lake? I'll remember your kindness."

The elephant king chuckled.  "Little mice," he boomed, "we're so big, we don't need your help! But okay, we'll take another path."

The elephants took a new route. But then, oh no!  The elephants got caught in hunter's traps!  The nets were strong, and they couldn't get out. 

The elephant king remembered the mouse king's promise! He sent another elephant to ask for help.

The mouse king called all his mice.  "It's time to help our friends!" he squeaked.  The tiny mice scurried to the traps and nibbled and nibbled on the strong nets until they were all loose! 

The elephants were free! They thanked the mice.  The elephant king and the mouse king became the best of friends. 

Remember:  Even the littlest creatures can be very helpful!
