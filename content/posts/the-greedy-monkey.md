A woman (wearing a blue sari, dark hair, calm expression) observes from a doorway, while a child (wearing red, light brown hair) watches from behind the woman.  The pots and pans are scattered, clothes are torn on the floor.  Use a bright, slightly chaotic color palette. Focus on capturing the monkey's mischievous energy.](/images/image_the-greedy-monkey0.png)


Once upon a time, there was a naughty monkey.  Every day, he would go to a man's house and cause trouble! He'd tear clothes, mess up the pots and pans, and even chase the children. He'd also steal food, but the family didn't complain much.  They were just very tired of him!

One day, the house helper said, "I'm going to catch this monkey!"  Everyone left the house. The monkey came in. After a little while, he jumped around and went outside. Then, he saw some chickpeas in a narrow-necked pot.  He sat down right there.

The monkey's face expresses frustration and greed. The house helper (same woman in blue sari but now closer) is in the background, a rope subtly visible in their hand.  The colors should be warm and earthy, with emphasis on the contrasting textures of the rough pot and the soft fur. Use muted tones to create a sense of anticipation.](/images/image_the-greedy-monkey1.png)

The monkey put his hand into the pot to grab the chickpeas. He took a big handful! But, because the pot's mouth was so small, he couldn't pull his hand out! He pushed and pushed, and he even jumped, but he wouldn't let go of the chickpeas!

The helper quickly came back and tied the monkey up with a rope! The greedy monkey was caught!

The narrow-necked pot with remaining chickpeas sits nearby.  The monkey looks dejected and smaller than before.  The overall scene is peaceful and slightly humorous, using a softer color palette with muted greens, browns, and blues to convey the resolution. The style should evoke a children's storybook illustration.](/images/image_the-greedy-monkey2.png)

**Lesson:** Greed is a bad thing!
