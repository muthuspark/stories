![Watercolor illustration, bathed in the warm, golden light of early morning, of a young man, representing the future Buddha, planting rice seedlings in a lush green field. Dew clings to the emerald blades of rice. His face is serene and focused, with a gentle smile playing on his lips. He wears simple, earth-toned robes. The rich brown mud splashes slightly as he works. The king's city of Benares can be seen distantly in the background, rendered in soft, muted tones of ochre and faded blues, partially obscured by a gentle morning mist. Birds flit amongst the distant rooftops. The artistic style should emulate traditional watercolor with soft blending and natural flow.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin0.png)

A long, long time ago, when a king named Brahma-datta ruled in Benares, the future Buddha was born into a farmer's family. When he grew up, he worked hard, planting and taking care of the land.

![Watercolor illustration, illuminated by the harsh midday sun, of a traveling salesman with a weathered face etched with years of hardship, leading a donkey laden with goods towards a village. Deep lines frame his eyes, conveying a mix of exhaustion and weary determination. He wears a dusty brown tunic and sandals. The donkey, its fur matted and dusty, is partly obscured by a neatly folded lion's skin on its back, appearing stiff and unnatural. The dusty road kicks up small clouds of beige dust. The village ahead is small, with thatched roofs and simple wooden structures baking in the heat. The color palette leans towards warm browns, yellows, and muted greens, reflecting the dry landscape. Emphasis on watercolor textures and natural flow of paint.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin1.png)

Around that time, a traveling salesman went from town to town. He had a donkey that carried all his goods.

![Watercolor illustration, in the soft glow of late afternoon, of a donkey, covered in a somewhat ill-fitting and slightly askew lion's skin, standing in a field of golden barley. The donkey looks slightly awkward and out of place, its ears drooping slightly, with villagers hiding timidly behind gnarled trees in the background. Their faces are filled with wide-eyed fear, peering from behind rough tree bark. The lion's skin is faded and patched, and the donkey's own grey fur peeks through in places. The barley field is swaying gently in a light breeze. The color palette uses warm yellows and greens, contrasted by the cool blues and purples of the approaching dusk. Watercolor effects should emphasize the texture of the barley and the rough bark of the trees.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin2.png)

Whenever he stopped, he would put a lion's skin on the donkey and let him loose in the fields of rice and barley. The people guarding the fields would see the donkey, but because he looked like a lion, they were too scared to go near him!


![Watercolor illustration, under a stormy, grey sky threatening rain, of villagers armed with sticks and farm tools charging towards a field of barley. Their faces are contorted with expressions of fear and determination, eyes wide and brows furrowed. Some are blowing cracked, earthenware horns and banging on dented drums, creating a cacophony of sound. Mud splatters their bare feet and simple clothing. A 'lion-donkey' is visible in the distance, a small, awkward silhouette against the golden barley. The color palette is dominated by greys and browns, punctuated by splashes of red on the faces and clothing of the villagers, conveying the urgency and fear of the scene. Emphasize the textural contrast between the smooth watercolor sky and the rough rendering of the villagers and their tools.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin3.png)

One day, the salesman stopped in a village. While he was waiting for his breakfast to cook, he dressed the donkey in the lion's skin and turned him loose in a field of barley. The field guards were frightened and ran home to tell everyone. Soon, all the villagers came running with sticks and tools! They blew horns and banged on drums as they got closer to the field and shouted loudly. The donkey was so scared that he made a sound â€“ he brayed like a donkey!

![Watercolor illustration, in the serene light filtering through a break in the storm clouds, of the future Buddha standing calmly in the middle of the frantic villagers. His robes are a calming shade of saffron. He points towards the 'lion-donkey' with a knowing expression, his eyes filled with compassion and amusement, his demeanor contrasting sharply with the chaos around him. The villagers around him are a blur of motion and fear. The rain-soaked barley field glistens in the newly emerged sunlight. His bare feet are firmly planted on the muddy ground. Use a brighter, more saturated palette for the Buddha, emphasizing his calm and illuminating presence against the darker, more muted tones of the surrounding chaos. Showcase the soft blending of colors and the natural flow of watercolor to emphasize his tranquility.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin4.png)

Then the future Buddha, who was also there, said this:

"That's not a lion's roar we hear,
Or a tiger's, or a panther's might;
It's just a donkey in disguise,
Braying with all his silly might!"

![Watercolor illustration, under a bright, unforgiving sun, of the donkey, no longer in disguise, being beaten by angry villagers in the barley field. The villagers' faces are twisted in rage, their sticks raised high. The lion skin lies discarded nearby, tattered and torn. The donkey's expression is one of pain and fear, its eyes wide with terror, its body cowering. Dust and straw fly up around the donkey's hooves. The color palette is harsh and bright, with strong contrasts between the light and shadows, reflecting the violence of the scene. Focus on capturing the movement and energy of the villagers and the donkey's suffering through dynamic watercolor techniques.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin5.png)

Once the villagers knew it was just a donkey, they got very angry. They chased him and hit him until he was badly hurt. They took the lion's skin and went home.

![Watercolor illustration, in the fading light of dusk, of the traveling salesman kneeling beside his injured donkey in the field. The donkey's breathing is shallow and ragged. He looks down at the donkey with a mixture of sadness and frustration, his face etched with regret. One hand rests gently on the donkey's flank, the other covers his face in distress. The discarded lion skin lies a few feet away. The barley field is now a subdued shade of gold. Use a palette of muted browns, greys, and purples to create a melancholic and somber atmosphere. Emphasize the texture of the salesman's worn clothes and the donkey's rough fur with layered watercolor washes.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin6.png)

Then the salesman came back and saw his poor donkey lying on the ground. He said:

"The donkey might have eaten well,
Dressed as a lion, big and bold.
But he brayed! What a silly thing!
That's the moment his story was told."

![Watercolor illustration, under a vast, empty sky tinged with the orange and purple hues of the setting sun, of a dead donkey lying in a field of barley. The discarded lion's skin lies beside the donkey as a symbol of his deception. The donkey's body is still and lifeless, casting a long shadow across the field. A few crows circle overhead. The setting sun casts a melancholic light over the scene, creating long, dramatic shadows. Use a palette of deep oranges, purples, and browns to create a sense of desolation and loss. Emphasize the texture of the dry barley stalks and the cracked earth with meticulous watercolor detailing, creating a stark and haunting image.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-ass-in-the-lions-skin7.png)

And as the salesman was saying those words, the poor donkey died right there in the field!
