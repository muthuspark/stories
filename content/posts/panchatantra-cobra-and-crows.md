Once upon a time, there was a big banyan tree.  A mommy and daddy crow made a cozy nest high up in the tree.  But, oh no!  A scary black cobra lived in a hole in the tree trunk.

The cobra was a meanie! Every time the mommy crow had baby crows, the cobra would eat them all up. The crows were very sad.

The crows went to a clever jackal for help.  The jackal lived in another banyan tree nearby.  "Please help us!" cried the crows. "The cobra is eating our babies!"

The jackal said, "Don't worry! Even the strongest enemy can be outsmarted!" 

The crows asked, "How? How can we trick the cobra?"

The jackal had a great plan. "Fly to the city," he said.  "Find a rich person who is careless.  See if they leave something valuable lying around.  If you find something, grab it when the servants are watching you. Fly slowly so the servants follow you.  Then drop it near the cobra's hole in the tree."

The crows flew to the city.  The mommy crow saw some shiny necklaces near a lake where rich ladies were swimming. The necklaces were made of gold and pearls, and some royal servants were guarding them.

Quickly, the mommy crow grabbed a big necklace and flew slowly back to the tree. The servants saw her and ran after her, throwing sticks and stones!

The mommy crow dropped the necklace near the cobra's hole and landed on a branch. When the servants arrived, the cobra popped out to see what all the fuss was about.  The servants were angry! They beat the cobra with their sticks and stones to get their necklace back.  The cobra was killed!

The crows were so happy!  They didn't have to worry about the cobra anymore. They lived happily ever after in their cozy nest.

Remember, even a big, scary problem can be solved with a little bit of cleverness!
