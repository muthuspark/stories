![Watercolor illustration: A slender, tan-colored jackal, Gomaya, with expressive brown eyes, is depicted cautiously approaching a large, dark brown drum in the foreground. The drum sits in a battlefield setting, rendered in muted greens, browns, and greys.  Dried leaves and twigs are scattered around the drum and food items, such as berries and a small pool of water, are visible near it. The sky is a soft, pale watercolor wash of blue and grey. The emphasis should be on the contrast between Gomaya's timid approach and the abundance of food he discovers.](/images/image_panchatantra-jackal-and-drum1.png)


Gomaya the jackal was very, very hungry!  He was looking for food everywhere.

He walked and walked, right out of the jungle and into an old battlefield.  A big battle had happened there a long time ago.

Gomaya saw a big drum lying near a tree.  Whoosh! The wind blew, and the tree branches bumped against the drum.  *Boom, boom!*  It made a scary noise!

Gomaya was scared! He wanted to run away.  "Maybe someone is making that noise!" he thought.

But then Gomaya thought again.  "Maybe I should see what's making that noise first!" he said.

He slowly, slowly crept closer.  He looked and looked.  It was just the wind! The wind was making the drum make noise.

Gomaya was so happy!  Near the drum, he found lots of yummy food and water!  He wasn't hungry anymore.

It's always good to be brave and find out what's happening before you run away!
