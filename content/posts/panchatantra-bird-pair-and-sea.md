![Watercolor illustration depicting a vibrant beach scene with powerful, expressive ocean waves.  A family of Tittibha birds (small, consistently colored) are centrally positioned, their expressions conveying fear, worry, and hope. In the upper section of the painting, subtly integrate Lord Vishnu (large, regal, in calming blues) overseeing the scene, and King Garuda (large, detailed, golden and majestic) subtly present above the chaos of the ocean. The other birds (swans, cranes, peacocks – easily distinguishable) should be subtly included within the background scene, smaller in scale than the Tittibha birds.](/images/image_panchatantra-bird-pair-and-sea1.png)

Once upon a time, near the ocean, lived a mommy and daddy Tittibha bird. Mommy bird was going to have baby birds! 

Mommy bird said to daddy bird, "Honey, can you find a safe place for my eggs?"

Daddy bird said, "Silly!  This beach is perfect!" 

But mommy bird worried, "The ocean waves are HUGE, especially at night! They could even take an elephant away!"

Daddy bird laughed, "The ocean wouldn't hurt my babies! Don't worry!" 

The ocean heard this and thought, "That little bird is so brave! I'll show him!" 

Mommy bird laid her eggs on the beach.  When the birds flew away to find food, the ocean made BIG waves!  The waves washed away the eggs! 

The birds came back and saw their eggs were gone! Mommy bird cried, "I told you!" 

Daddy bird said, "Don't worry! I'll dry up the whole ocean and get our eggs back!" 

Mommy bird said, "How?  Lots of rivers pour into the ocean!" 

Daddy bird said, "I'll use my beak! It's strong like iron!"

Mommy bird knew she couldn't change his mind. She said, "Ask your friends to help!" 

Daddy bird asked his friends – swans, cranes, peacocks – for help.  They all said, "That's impossible! Let's ask King Garuda! He's the king of the birds!" 

They all went to King Garuda. They explained what happened. Garuda wanted to help but Lord Vishnu needed help with something important! Garuda said he wouldn't help Lord Vishnu until the ocean gave back the eggs! 

Lord Vishnu heard about this and went to Garuda. He said, "The ocean was wrong! I'll get the eggs back!" 

Lord Vishnu went to the ocean and said, "Give back the eggs, or else!" 

The ocean was scared and quickly returned the eggs. 

The Tittibha birds got their eggs back!  Even small birds can be brave! And even the biggest ocean must listen to Lord Vishnu!
