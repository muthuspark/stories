![A watercolor painting depicting a wise old man with flowing robes of calming teal and sage green hues watching two golden-furred rams butt heads in a jungle setting. The rams, rendered with a sense of dynamic motion, are covered in small red splashes indicating blood.  A smaller, brown jackal with sharp features is intensely focused on lapping up the blood near the ramsâ€™ feet, completely ignoring the impending collision. The background jungle should be depicted with a loose, expressive watercolor style, using various shades of green, yellow, and brown to evoke a sense of wild, untamed nature.](/images/image_panchatantra-fighting-goats-and-jackal2.png)


A wise old man was walking through a jungle.  He saw two fluffy golden rams, like big billy goats, fighting!  They were bumping heads and hurting each other, blood even dripped from their cuts.  But they kept on fighting! 

Then, a hungry jackal came along.  The jackal saw all the blood and started lapping it up! He was so busy licking, he didn't even look at the fighting rams.

The wise man thought, "That jackal is silly! He's so greedy for the blood, he doesn't see the danger!"  

Just then, the jackal, wanting more blood, walked right between the fighting rams!  BAM!  The rams bumped into him by accident.  Poor jackal! He got hurt and fell down.

The wise man smiled.  He knew it was important to be careful and not get too greedy, or you might get hurt!
