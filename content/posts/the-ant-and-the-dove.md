One hot summer day, a little ant was looking for water.  She walked and walked until she saw a river.  She was so happy! She climbed onto a small rock to take a drink, but she slipped and fell into the water! 

Just then, a dove saw her. The dove was sitting in a nearby tree.  Seeing the ant in trouble, the dove quickly dropped a leaf into the water.

The ant crawled onto the leaf. The dove carefully pulled the leaf out of the water and onto the ground. The ant was safe! She was so grateful to the dove.

After that, the ant and the dove became best friends.  But one day, a hunter came into the forest. He saw the beautiful dove in the tree and aimed his gun!

The ant saw everything. She quickly bit the hunter's heel! The hunter yelled in pain and dropped his gun. The dove, scared by the noise, flew away to safety.


When the hunter left, the dove came back to thank the ant for saving its life.  The ant and the dove helped each other when they were in trouble. 

**The End**

**Lesson:**  Always help others when they need it. Helping someone is never a waste!
