![A watercolor painting of the final scene: A lonely, emaciated brown cobra lies coiled at the bottom of a deserted well, surrounded by the shadows of past victims. A few wilting water plants suggest the passage of time and the cobra's despair. Gangadatta, a small green figure, is shown in the far distance, happily hopping away, silhouetted against a vibrant sunset. This image should emphasize the cobra's isolation and the moral of the story. Employ a palette of muted browns, greens, and oranges, with a strong contrast between the dark well and the bright sunset.](/images/image_panchatantra-greedy-cobra-and-king-of-frogs2.png)


Once upon a time, a frog named Gangadatta was the king of all the frogs in a well!  But his frog relatives were always bothering him.  He was so tired of them, he climbed out of the well one day and left! 

Gangadatta wanted revenge on his annoying relatives. Then, he saw a big snake slithering into a hole! He had a sneaky plan.

He called out to the snake, "Hello! I'm the frog king! Let's be friends!" 

The snake was a cobra, and cobras eat frogs! He was very suspicious. "Are you trying to trick me? Frogs and snakes are enemies!" 

Gangadatta said, "It's true, but I want to get back at my bad relatives.  You can eat all the frogs in my well!" 

The cobra asked, "How will I get in? I don't have legs!" 

Gangadatta said, "There's a cozy hole near the water. I'll show you!  But promise you'll only eat my mean relatives!" 

The old cobra was hungry, so he agreed.  Gangadatta led him to the hole. The cobra ate and ate, gobbling up all the annoying frogs! 

Soon, only Gangadatta and his nice frog friends were left. The cobra was still hungry! "There are no more bad frogs!" he said. "Give me more!" 

Gangadatta was scared. The cobra ate all his friends! Only Gangadatta was left.

Gangadatta promised to bring more frogs from other wells.  The cobra, being greedy, let him go. But Gangadatta never came back! 

The cobra waited and waited, until he asked a lizard to send a message to Gangadatta.  Gangadatta replied, "Tell the cobra I'm never coming back!  A hungry cobra is very dangerous!" 

The greedy cobra starved in the well.  The story teaches us: It's best to solve your own problems!
