Once upon a time, in a nearby forest, a hungry donkey was sadly crying.  He was sad because his owner hadn't fed him properly after a long day's work.

A sly jackal was passing by and saw the hungry donkey.

"What's wrong, donkey?" asked the jackal.

"I'm very, very hungry! I've eaten everything here, but I'm still hungry!" cried the donkey.

Hearing the donkey's sad story, the jackal said, "Oh, you know there's a big field of fresh vegetables nearby. You can go there and eat your fill!"

"Please take me there!" said the donkey.

The jackal took the donkey to the field. Once there, they quietly munched on the fresh vegetables.  Suddenly, they heard someone coming! They both ran away.

From then on, both animals went to the vegetable garden every day and ate their fill. But one day, their luck ran out. A farmer saw them and chased them away!

That day, both animals were hungry. As night fell, the jackal suggested they sneak back into the vegetable garden for another feast.

Under the cover of darkness, the donkey and the jackal crept into the field and began to eat.  While eating, the donkey had an idea.  "Oh, look at these delicious cucumbers and the beautiful moon! It's so lovely, I want to sing a song!" he exclaimed.

"Not now! You can't sing here!" said the jackal.

"But I want to sing!" the donkey said angrily.

The jackal tried to explain, "The farmer will hear you! We might get caught!" But the donkey wouldn't listen and started to sing.

A little way off, the farmer and his family heard a donkey braying. They ran towards the donkey with sticks.

They chased the donkey away, beating him as they went.

"Ouch-ouch-ouch!" cried the donkey in pain, running back to the jackal and telling him everything.

Hearing his story, the jackal said, "You should have waited until we were out of the field before singing! You didn't listen to me, and now you've been hurt. Come on, you need some rest! Don't ever do that again!"  The jackal then went away.

The donkey was punished for his actions, but he also learned a valuable lesson. 

**Lesson:** There's a right time and place for everything. Always think about the best time and place to do things!
