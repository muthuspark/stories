title: "The Lion's Throne"

![Watercolor painting emphasizing the contrast between the lion's initial pride and his subsequent fall.  The lion, a consistent burnt orange-brown, is shown in two main scenes. In the first, he is large and imposing, commanding a group of smaller jungle animals (consistently colored and sized) who are building him a seat on an elephant.  The second scene shows the lion lying on the ground after falling from the elephant's back, his injured leg visible; his expression is one of humility. The background should be a soft watercolor wash of jungle greens and blues, with a small figure of a king on an elephant throne visible in the distance.](/images/image_the-lions-throne2.png)

Once upon a time, there was a very strong lion in the jungle.  All the other animals were scared of him because he was so powerful!

One day, the king of a nearby city came to visit the jungle. The lion saw that the king was sitting on a beautiful seat on top of an elephant!

The lion really wanted to sit on a seat on an elephant too. He called all the jungle animals and told them to make a seat for him on the elephant's back.

The animals quickly made the seat. The lion jumped on, excited to sit on his new throne! But when the elephant started walking, the seat wobbled, and the lion fell down with a big *BUMP*!

His leg was hurt!  The lion limped and said, "Walking on my own two feet is much better!" 

**The End**

**Lesson:**  It's best to do what you're good at. We should try to use our own brains and not copy others.
