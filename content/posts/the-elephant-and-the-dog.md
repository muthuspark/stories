Once upon a time, a king's elephant was eating grass near a small hill.  He heard a hungry little sound.

It was a dog eating leftover food from the elephant keeper's plate. The keeper wasn't around.  The elephant was used to being alone, so he didn't mind the dog at first.

Soon, the elephant and the dog became best friends and played together all the time! The keeper didn't mind either.

One day, a farmer saw the dog and asked the keeper if he could have him. Since the dog wasn't the keeper's, he said yes and gave the dog away.

Without his friend, the elephant became very sad. He stopped eating, drinking, and playing. He just stayed on the hill and wouldn't leave.

The king came to visit his elephant and saw how sad and sick he looked. The elephant wasn't eating or doing anything! 

The king called the royal doctor.  The doctor checked the elephant and said, "Your Majesty, the elephant is perfectly healthy, but it seems he's lost a friend!" 

The king called the keeper and asked what happened. The keeper said, "Oh, there was a dog here. I gave him away to a farmer." 

The king sent a guard to bring the dog back. As soon as the dog was brought back to the hill, the elephant saw his little friend, got very happy, and started playing again!

From that day on, the elephant and the dog were even better friends. Their friendship was very strong.

**Lesson:** We should care for our friends, and true friendship lasts forever.
