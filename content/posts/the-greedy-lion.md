title: "The Greedy Lion"

![Watercolor painting of a lion, consistently colored burnt orange and ochre with a large, slightly grumpy mane, and a small, brown rabbit with long ears.  The background is a lush, vibrant green jungle scene painted in loose watercolor style.  The lion is depicted twice: once large and menacing, approaching a small, slightly blurry deer in the mid-ground; the second, smaller and dejected, looking sadly at an empty space where the rabbit once sat.  The deer should be a soft, muted brown. Use a limited palette of greens, browns, and oranges. Focus on capturing the contrast in the lion's demeanor between the two scenes, highlighting his hunger and regret.](/images/image_the-greedy-lion0.png)

One hot summer day, a lion in the jungle felt very, very hungry. He started looking for food.

After searching for a while, he found a rabbit. But the lion thought the rabbit was too small, so he left it!

Then, he saw a deer.  He chased it, but because he was so hungry and tired, he couldn't catch it. 

Now, he had nothing to eat. He remembered the rabbit!  

He went back to where he'd seen it, but the rabbit was gone! The lion was very sad and went hungry for many days.

**Lesson:** This story teaches us not to be greedy.
