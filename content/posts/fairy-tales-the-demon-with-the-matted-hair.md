![Watercolor illustration of the Teacher (Buddha), sitting in Jetavana, surrounded by monks. The monks are young and old, their faces reflecting rapt attention. The Teacher has a serene expression, his eyes closed in contemplation, a gentle smile gracing his lips. He is seated on a simple mat beneath a bodhi tree, its leaves rustling gently in the breeze. The air is filled with the scent of incense. In the background, subtly depicted as transparent, ethereal images, are faint, ghost-like images of the Prince and the Demon, locked in their struggle and eventual understanding. These ghostly figures are integrated into the trees and foliage. The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a sense of tranquility. Color palette: Earthy tones, with soft greens and browns, and a hint of gold. Emotional tone: Peaceful, wise, contemplative. Artistic style: Watercolor with a focus on spiritual serenity and subtle details.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair6.png)

The Teacher in Jetavana told a story about a monk who had stopped trying to be good. The Teacher asked him, "Is it true you've stopped trying?" The monk said, "Yes." Then the Teacher said, "A long time ago, smart people tried really hard and became kings!" And he told this story:


Long, long ago, King Brahmadatta ruled Benares. His wife had a baby boy, who was the Bodhisatta. On his birthday, they asked 800 wise men about his future. The wise men looked at the baby and said:

"Your son is a good boy! When you pass away, he'll be king. He'll be famous for being great with swords, spears, bows, axes, and shields. Everyone in India will know him!"

They named him the Prince of the Five Weapons because of what the wise men said.

When he was about sixteen, the King told him, "Son, it's time to finish your learning."

The Prince asked, "Who will teach me?"

The King said, "Go to Takkasila, in Candahar. There's a famous teacher there. Give him this money as a gift." He gave the Prince a thousand coins.

Golden hour light streams through tall, arched palace windows, casting long, dramatic shadows across the polished marble floor. The light catches the dust motes dancing in the air. The king is seated on a richly carved teak throne, draped with velvet cushions of deep crimson and gold. His face is lined with age but softened with affection, and his hand rests gently on the prince's head. The prince is dressed in simple, yet finely woven, princely robes of saffron and cream. His expression is one of humble gratitude. The background features intricately painted murals depicting scenes of past kings and their glorious deeds. Soft, blending watercolor washes create a sense of depth and ethereal beauty. Emotional tone: Warm, familial, hopeful.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair0.png)

The Prince went to the teacher and learned a lot. The teacher gave him the Five Weapons as a present. The Prince said goodbye and started his trip back to Benares, carrying his weapons.

On his way, he came to a forest where a scary Demon with Matted Hair lived. Some people at the edge of the forest warned him:

"Hey, watch out! There's a Demon in there with crazy hair! He hurts anyone he sees!" They tried to stop him, but the Prince was brave and walked right in, like a fearless lion.

![Watercolor illustration of the Prince of the Five Weapons, now older, around twenty-five, standing confidently at the edge of a dark and foreboding forest at twilight. The last rays of the setting sun paint the sky in hues of deep orange, purple, and bruised blue. He carries his five weapons (sword, spear, bow with arrows, axe, and shield) strapped to his back; the leather straps are worn and slightly cracked. The weapons themselves are weathered, showing signs of use. He gazes intently into the woods, his jaw firm and his eyes filled with determination. The forest is thick with gnarled trees, their branches reaching like skeletal fingers. Fallen leaves litter the ground, creating a damp, earthy aroma (implied). Shadows deepen amongst the trees, obscuring what lies within. Color palette: Dark greens, browns, purples, with fiery highlights from the sunset. Emotional tone: Foreboding, courageous, determined. Artistic style: Watercolor with rough edges and textured paper effect.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair1.png)

In the middle of the forest, the Demon showed up! He was as tall as a tree, with a head as big as a house, eyes like giant plates, and bumpy teeth. He had a hawk's face and colorful tummy, with blue hands and feet.

"Where do you think you're going?" he roared. "Stop! You're my dinner!"

The Prince said, "Demon, I'm not scared of you. I'm warning you to stay away! I have a poisoned arrow that will knock you down!" He put a poisoned arrow in his bow and shot it. The arrow stuck in the Demon's hair. He shot fifty arrows, and they all stuck in the Demon's hair. The Demon just snapped them off and threw them down. Then he walked up to the Prince.

![Watercolor illustration of the Demon with Matted Hair, towering over the Prince of the Five Weapons. The Demon is depicted with a tree-trunk-sized body covered in bark-like skin, a house-sized head with a mossy crown, plate-sized eyes glowing with inner fire, bumpy, yellowed teeth, a hawk-like face with a hooked nose, a colorful stomach with swirling patterns resembling a cosmic nebula, and blue, clawed hands and feet. Arrows are sticking harmlessly in its matted, dreadlock-like hair, some broken, some bent. The prince looks incredibly small in comparison. The forest floor is uneven and muddy, with exposed roots and decaying logs. The lighting is dappled and eerie, filtering through the dense canopy. Color palette: Greens, browns, blues, and reds, with a sense of unnatural vibrancy. Emotional tone: Fear, awe, precariousness. Artistic style: Watercolor with a sense of exaggerated scale and grotesque detail.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair2.png)

The Prince pulled out his sword and swung it at the Demon. The sword got stuck in the Demon's hair too! He hit him with his spear, and it stuck! He hit him with his club, and it stuck too!

The Prince realized all his weapons were stuck. "Demon!" he yelled. "Have you never heard of me, the Prince of the Five Weapons? I didn't trust just my weapons. I'm going to smash you into dust!"

He punched the Demon with his right hand. It stuck! He punched him with his left hand, and it stuck too! He kicked him with his right foot, and it stuck! Then he kicked with his left, and it stuck too! Then he bumped him with his head, shouting, "I'll grind you to powder!" And his head stuck fast too!

So, the Prince was stuck in five places, hanging in the air! But he wasn't scared, not even a little bit.

![Watercolor illustration of the Prince of the Five Weapons stuck to the Demon with Matted Hair in five places (hands, feet, and head). The Demon appears perplexed and slightly worried, scratching its head (or attempting to) with a clawed hand. The prince is struggling, his face strained with effort. The scene is set in the middle of the dark forest, with a thick layer of fog clinging to the ground. Close-up details include the sticky resin oozing from the Demon's skin, creating a sense of discomfort. The trees are blurred in the background, adding to the feeling of disorientation. Color palette: Muted greens, browns, and grays, with subtle highlights on the characters' faces. Emotional tone: Humorous, tense, desperate. Artistic style: Watercolor with a focus on expressions and body language.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair3.png)

The Demon thought, "Wow, this guy is strong! He's caught by a scary Demon like me, but he's not afraid. I've never seen anyone like this. Why isn't he scared?" He couldn't eat him, so he asked, "Hey, why aren't you scared to death?"

The Prince replied, "Why should I be afraid? You can only die once! Besides, I have a thunderbolt in my belly! If you eat me, it will break you into tiny pieces and kill you! That's why I'm not scared!" (He meant the smartness he had learned.)

The Demon thought, "He's right! Even a little bit of him would be too much for me. I'll let him go!" So, he let the Prince go, saying:

"You're a brave man! I won't eat you. I'm setting you free! Go back to your friends and family!"

The Prince said, "I'll go. But you were a mean Demon because you did bad things in your past life. If you keep being bad, things will get worse. Now that you've seen me, you should be good. Hurting others causes you to be born as an animal, or a ghost, or a monster. And if you're born as a person, your life will be short."

He told the Demon all about the bad things that happen when you're mean and the good things that happen when you're kind. He scared the Demon a little and taught him to be good. He made him promise to worship the special spirit of the forest. Then he left.

![Watercolor illustration of the Prince of the Five Weapons, now freed, standing before the Demon with Matted Hair. The prince is calmly speaking, his hand raised in a gesture of teaching, his face serene and compassionate. The Demon is listening intently, its massive head tilted slightly, its plate-sized eyes now filled with curiosity and a hint of remorse. The forest is still dark, with twisted branches and gnarled roots, but hints of sunlight are beginning to break through the canopy, illuminating patches of moss-covered ground. Birds begin to sing in the distance. The air is still heavy with moisture but carries a hint of fresh growth. The Prince's clothes are ripped in multiple spots, showing the wear of the fight. Color palette: Soft greens, browns, and golds, with a sense of emerging hope. Emotional tone: Peaceful, transformative, hopeful. Artistic style: Watercolor with a soft, diffused light and a focus on the characters' emotional connection.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair4.png)

At the edge of the forest, he told everyone what happened. Then he went on to Benares, carrying his Five Weapons. Later, he became king and ruled well. He gave to the poor and did good things. When he died, he went to a good place because of his good deeds.

![Watercolor illustration of the Prince of the Five Weapons, back in Benares, now crowned as king. He is seated on a golden throne, intricately carved with images of mythical creatures. He is dispensing alms to the poor and needy, who line up before him. Some are elderly and infirm, others are young children. Their faces are etched with hardship, but their eyes gleam with hope as they receive the king's generosity. The scene is bright and prosperous, symbolizing his good rule. The palace walls are adorned with vibrant tapestries, and the air is filled with the sounds of music and laughter. Baskets of fruit and vegetables overflow at the edges of the scene. Golden sunlight floods the courtyard. Color palette: Rich golds, reds, and greens, with a sense of abundance and prosperity. Emotional tone: Generous, benevolent, hopeful. Artistic style: Watercolor with vibrant colors and detailed depictions of the crowd.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-demon-with-the-matted-hair5.png)

When the Teacher finished the story, he felt very wise and said this:

Someone who doesn't want too much,
Someone who is good,
Will break free from bad things,
And live a good life.

Then the Teacher told them that Angulimala was the Demon and he himself was the Prince of the Five Weapons!
