Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest, lived a deer named Surily.  Surily had a baby daughter named Mriganaini, who was only five months old.  Mriganaini loved to explore the forest with her mommy.

One day, while playing, two sneaky jackals appeared!  They wanted to catch and eat little Mriganaini.

Brave Surily used her antlers to fight the jackals. She pushed and poked them, trying to protect her baby.


But the jackals were mean and wouldn't give up!

Suddenly, lots and lots of other deer arrived! They all chased the jackals away, running faster and faster until the jackals were gone for good.

Surily and Mriganaini were safe!  Their family had saved them.

**Lesson:** When we all work together, we can overcome any challenge!
