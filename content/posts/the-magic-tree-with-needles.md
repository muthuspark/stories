title: "The Magic Tree with Needles"

![Watercolor painting of two brothers near a large, dark forest. The older brother, depicted with sharper features and wearing dark clothing (consistent deep blue tones), is sprawled on the ground beneath a glowing, whimsical tree with golden leaves, covered in tiny, sharp needles.  The younger brother, with softer features and wearing lighter clothing (consistent light greens and yellows), is kneeling beside him, gently pulling out the needles. The tree is detailed with vibrant, golden apples partially visible. Use a palette dominated by warm earth tones, contrasting with the cool blues and greens of the forest and the older brother's clothing.  Both brothers should be roughly the same size, with similar body shapes to distinguish them as siblings.  The style should evoke a classic fairytale illustration.](/images/image_the-magic-tree-with-needles0.png)

Once upon a time, near a big forest, lived two brothers. The older brother was very naughty and mean to his younger brother. He would often eat all of his brother's food or wear his new clothes. 

One day, the older brother decided to cut down some wood from the forest and sell it in the market to earn money.  As he chopped wood, he stumbled upon a magical tree. 

He raised his axe to chop a branch, but the tree said, "Please don't cut my branches! If you spare me, I'll give you golden apples!" 

The older brother agreed, but he was greedy. He threatened the tree, saying he wanted more golden apples or he would chop it down. 

Instead of giving him apples, the tree showered him with needles!  The needles stung him, and he cried out in pain, falling to the ground. 

As evening approached, the younger brother worried about his older brother and went to look for him in the forest. After searching, he found his brother under the magical tree, covered in needles.  Feeling sorry for him, he carefully pulled out all the needles. 

The older brother watched, feeling ashamed of his actions. He apologized to his younger brother for being mean and promised never to do it again. 

The magical tree saw the change in the older brother's heart and happily gave both brothers many golden apples. 

The story teaches us to be kind and gentle because kind people are always rewarded.
