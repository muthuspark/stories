title: "The Scorpion and the Saint"

![Watercolor painting of a compassionate saint, depicted with gentle, flowing robes in warm ochre and brown, repeatedly rescuing a small, detailed scorpion (dark brown/black with a subtle, iridescent sheen) from a rushing stream rendered in cool blues and greens.  The saint's expression remains serene throughout multiple repetitions of the rescue. In the background, a small figure of a doctor (wearing a lighter blue and white outfit) observes the scene with a surprised expression, holding a stick.  The style should be reminiscent of traditional Indian miniature paintings, emphasizing the narrative and moral lesson. The overall palette should be soft and harmonious.](/images/image_the-scorpion-and-the-saint0.png)

It was a rainy day. A little scorpion was being swept away by a fast-flowing stream.  A kind saint saw the scorpion struggling and carefully picked it up with his hand. 

But, because scorpions like to sting, the scorpion stung the saint!  The scorpion fell back into the stream. 

The saint, being very kind, picked up the scorpion again.  And guess what? The scorpion stung him again! This happened a few more times.

A doctor lived nearby, and he saw what was happening. He ran over and used a stick to move the scorpion far away.  

He asked the saint, "You know scorpions always sting. Why did you keep saving it even after it hurt you?" 

The saint smiled and said, "A scorpion can't change its nature, so why should I change mine?" 

Hearing this, the doctor bowed down to the saint in respect.

**Lesson:**  Even when things are difficult, we shouldn't change who we are!
