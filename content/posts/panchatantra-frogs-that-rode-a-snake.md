Once upon a time, near a big mountain, lived a very old snake named Mandavishya. He was so old he couldn't catch frogs to eat!  He thought, "I'm too weak to hunt. I need a new plan!" 

He had a clever idea. He went to a pond full of frogs and pretended to be sleepy. He didn't try to catch any.  

At first, the frogs were scared, but Mandavishya was so still, they got brave and hopped closer. One frog asked, "Mr. Snake, why aren't you hunting us?"

Mandavishya said, "Oh, I'm very unlucky! I accidentally bit a boy, and a magical man made me promise to only help frogs! I'll give anyone a ride on my back!" 

The frog king heard about this and wanted a ride!  Mandavishya gave him a fun ride around the pond. All the frogs loved it!  Mandavishya showed off his cool crawling moves. Everyone had a great time!

The next day, Mandavishya pretended to be very weak.  The frog king asked, "What's wrong?"

"I'm too tired! I need to eat to be strong enough to give you rides," said Mandavishya.

The kind frog king decided to give Mandavishya one frog each day to help him get stronger.  That was exactly what Mandavishya wanted! He gave more fun rides.

Soon, Mandavishya was strong again! He ate a frog every day. The frog king was so happy, he didn't notice that there were fewer and fewer frogs!

One day, a big black snake came to the pond. He saw Mandavishya carrying frogs. "Why are you carrying them? They're our food!" he asked.

Mandavishya told him everything.  He said, "I love my new easy life! I've tried all kinds of yummy frogs!" 

Over time, Mandavishya ate even the other snakes!  He ate the frog king and all his friends.  There were no frogs left! 

Remember: Be careful! Not everyone is your friend, even if they seem nice.
