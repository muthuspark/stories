title: "The Clever Rooster"

Once upon a time, in a little village, lived many, many roosters.  One day, some children teased one of the roosters.

The rooster felt very sad. He thought, "Tomorrow morning, I won't make any noise!  Everyone will sleep in, and then they'll understand how important I am, and they won't tease me anymore." 

The next morning, the rooster stayed quiet.  But everyone woke up at their usual time and went about their day.  The rooster learned that nobody's work stopped just because he was quiet. Everyone's work continued as usual.

**Lesson:** We should never be proud of our work.  Nobody is indispensable.  Everyone's work is important, but no one person is more important than the whole.
