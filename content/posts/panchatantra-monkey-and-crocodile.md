![Watercolor painting of a vibrant scene: Ricky, a cheerful brown monkey with large expressive eyes, sitting in a lush, green jamun tree laden with dark purple berries, sharing berries with Carl, a large green crocodile with friendly eyes, near a gently flowing river. The style should be whimsical and slightly cartoonish, with soft, blended watercolor washes for a dreamy atmosphere. The overall palette should be warm and inviting, using bright greens, purples, browns, and teals.](/images/image_panchatantra-monkey-and-crocodile0.png)



Once upon a time, near a river, lived a monkey named Ricky.  Ricky lived in a jamun tree – a tree full of yummy, sweet jamun berries! He loved playing and eating the juicy berries all day long.

One day, a crocodile named Carl came to rest under the tree. Ricky saw Carl and said, "Welcome, Carl!  This is my home.  Have some jamun berries!"  Ricky gave Carl lots and lots of sweet berries.

Carl loved the berries and became friends with Ricky. Every day, Carl visited Ricky, and they ate jamun berries together and chatted.

Ricky, depicted as a small, agile brown monkey with a mischievous grin, is leaping from Carl’s back (Carl is a large, somewhat grumpy green crocodile) towards the jamun tree, purple jamun berries falling around them. The background features a serene river and a partially visible jamun tree. Use a loose watercolor style with visible brushstrokes, emphasizing movement and energy.  Maintain consistent character colors and sizes throughout.](/images/image_panchatantra-monkey-and-crocodile1.png)

One day, Carl said, "My wife would love these berries! Can I take some home?"  Ricky happily gave him a big bunch.

Carl's wife loved the berries!  But then she said something terrible, "If the monkey eats these berries every day, he must taste even better! Bring me his heart!" 

Carl was shocked! He didn't want to hurt his friend. But his wife wouldn't stop asking, so Carl felt very sad and made a plan.


He told Ricky, "My wife wants to meet you! She's invited you for dinner!" Ricky agreed, but he couldn't swim! Carl said, "Hop on my back, I'll carry you!" 

Ricky hopped on, and Carl started swimming.  As they went deeper, Ricky got scared.  Carl then said, "Ricky, my wife wants your heart!" 

Ricky was surprised but smart! He said, "Oh! I should have known! My heart is in the tree’s trunk. Let's go get it!"

The background is a blurred image of a jamun tree with hanging purple fruits. The style should be expressive, using contrasting dark and light washes in the water to highlight the drama, and soft, muted tones for the monkey and crocodile. The overall mood should be one of suspense, just before Ricky's escape.](/images/image_panchatantra-monkey-and-crocodile2.png)


The silly crocodile turned around.  As soon as Ricky was close enough, he jumped off Carl's back and climbed up the tree! 

Carl shouted, "What's taking so long?" 

Ricky called back, "Silly Carl!  How can I take out my own heart?! You tried to trick me, so I tricked you! Go away and never come back!" 

Carl felt bad and went away.  Ricky was safe!  The end.

Remember, it's always better to be kind and clever!
