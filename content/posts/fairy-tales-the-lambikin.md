![A tiny, fluffy white Lambikin with oversized, wobbly legs hopping happily along a grassy path bathed in the warm golden light of late afternoon. Sunlight dappled with long shadows dances through the leaves of towering oak trees in the background, creating a sense of whimsical joy. The Lambikin has a joyous expression on its face, its wool catching the sunlight and appearing almost translucent. Soft watercolor blending gives the impression of gentle movement. The grass is a vibrant green with subtle yellow undertones, and tiny wildflowers bloom along the edge of the path. The overall tone is cheerful and innocent.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin0.png)

Once upon a time, there was a tiny little Lambikin who loved to hop and skip around on his wobbly little legs. He was so happy!


One day, he decided to visit his Grandma. He was bouncing with excitement because he knew she would give him yummy treats. But then, he bumped into a Jackal! The Jackal looked at the cute, little Lambikin and said, "Lambikin! Lambikin! I'm going to EAT YOU!"

The Jackal, with matted fur and piercing yellow eyes, is leering down at the tiny Lambikin with an open mouth showing sharp teeth, casting a long, menacing shadow. The Lambikin looks slightly startled but maintains a confident stance, its tiny hooves firmly planted on the ground, a flicker of defiance in its bright blue eyes. The dirt path is dry and cracked, and the color palette is muted and slightly desaturated to create a sense of unease. A single withered tree stands barren in the background, adding to the ominous atmosphere.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin1.png)

But Lambikin just did a little jump and said:

    "To Grandma's house I go,
    Where I will get nice and plump, you know,
    Then you can eat me, oh so slow!"

The Jackal thought that sounded like a good idea, so he let Lambikin go on his way.

Later on, he met a Vulture. The Vulture looked very hungry as he looked at Lambikin and said, "Lambikin! Lambikin! I'm going to EAT YOU!"

But Lambikin just did a little jump, and said:

    "To Grandma's house I go,
    Where I will get nice and plump, you know,
    Then you can eat me, oh so slow!"

The Vulture thought that was fair, and let Lambikin pass.

And then he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle! All of them saw the sweet little Lambikin and said, "Lambikin! Lambikin! I'm going to EAT YOU!"

But Lambikin always answered with a little jump:

    "To Grandma's house I go,
    Where I will get nice and plump, you know,
    Then you can eat me, oh so slow!"

Finally, he got to his Grandma's house. He said very quickly, "Grandma, I promised to get really fat! So, because you should keep your promises, please put me in the grain bin right away!"

The cottage is small and quaint, with a thatched roof and ivy climbing up the stone walls. His Grandma, a kind-looking sheep with gentle wrinkles around her eyes and a warm, woolly shawl, is smiling warmly at the Lambikin, her face radiating affection. The scene is bathed in the soft light of a sunny morning, casting gentle shadows across the yard. Chickens peck at the ground nearby, and the air is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread. The grain bin is overflowing, suggesting abundance and generosity.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin2.png)

His Grandma said he was a good boy and put him in the grain bin. The greedy little Lambikin stayed there for a whole week! He ate and ate and ate until he could barely walk. His Grandma said he was fat enough and had to go home. But clever Lambikin said that wouldn't work because some animal would eat him on the way back since he was so chubby.

"I know what you should do!" said Lambikin. "You can make a little drum out of my brother's skin, the one who died. Then I can sit inside, and roll along! I'm as round as a drum myself!"

So, his Grandma made a nice little drum out of his brother's skin with the wool still inside.

Tools and sewing supplies – spools of colorful thread, needles, thimbles, and scraps of fabric – are scattered around on a rough-hewn wooden workbench. Her spectacles are perched on her nose as she concentrates on her work, her brow furrowed slightly in concentration. The woolly skin of the drum is stretched taut and shows signs of wear, suggesting it has been loved and used before. A half-finished cup of tea sits steaming on a nearby table, and the overall feeling is one of warmth, creativity, and loving dedication.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin3.png)

Lambikin curled up all cozy and warm inside and rolled away happily.

The inside of the drum is cozy and dimly lit, lined with soft wool and smelling faintly of lavender. The Lambikin's wool is soft and fluffy, and his expression is one of playful cunning. The color palette is warm and inviting, creating a sense of security and comfort. The watercolor technique emphasizes the texture of the wool and the subtle details of the Lambikin's face.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin6.png)

Soon, he met the Eagle, who called out:

    "Drum! Little Drum!
    Have you seen Lambikin come?"

And Lambikin, all snug inside his soft, warm nest, replied:

    "Fallen in the fire, so will you!
    Rolling little Drum! Tum-pa, tum-too!"

"How annoying!" sighed the Eagle, sadly thinking about the yummy Lambikin he had missed.

Meanwhile, Lambikin rolled along, giggling to himself, and singing:

    "Tum-pa, tum-too!
    Tum-pa, tum-too!"

Every animal and bird he met asked him the same question:

    "Drum! Little Drum!
    Have you seen Lambikin come?"

And to each of them, the sneaky little Lambikin replied:

    "Fallen in the fire, so will you!
    Rolling little Drum! Tum-pa, tum-too!
    Tum-pa, tum-too! Tum-pa, tum-too!"

Then they all sighed, thinking about the delicious little Lambikin they had missed.

The background features various disappointed-looking animals (Eagle with ruffled feathers, Wolf with drooped ears, Tiger with a dejected expression, Dog with a hang-dog look) gazing sadly at the drum as it passes them by, each rendered with distinct personalities and detailed textures. The drum is covered in whimsical patterns and is rolling quickly, kicking up tufts of grass. The colors are vibrant and cheerful, and the overall tone is lighthearted and comedic. The watercolor technique emphasizes the soft, fluffy texture of the wool.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin4.png)

Finally, the Jackal came limping along. Even though he looked sad, he was still as clever as ever. He called out:

    "Drum! Little Drum!
    Have you seen Lambikin come?"

And Lambikin, curled up in his cozy little nest, happily replied:

    "Fallen in the fire, so will you!
    Rolling little Drum! Tum-pa---"

But he didn't get to finish, because the Jackal knew his voice right away! He shouted, "Hey! You've turned yourself inside out, haven't you? Get out of that drum!"

![A watercolor scene of a Jackal, eyes wide with predatory glee, ripping open a small drum made of wool with its sharp claws under the pale light of a full moon. The mangled drum is bursting open, with scraps of wool and bits of wood scattered around, and a partially visible, terrified Lambikin is inside, huddled in a corner and trembling with fear. The colors are dark and muted, with shadows adding to the sense of danger and foreboding. The Jackal's claws are rendered in sharp detail, and the overall effect is both unsettling and dramatic. The inside of the drum is dark and claustrophobic, highlighting the Lambikin's vulnerability.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin5.png)

Then he ripped open the drum and gobbled up Lambikin.

![A watercolor image of Lambikin's Grandma standing in front of her quaint cottage at dusk, her face etched with worry and concern as she watches a dark shadow (implying the Jackal) disappear over the rolling hills on the horizon. The sky is painted in shades of purple, orange, and pink, creating a dramatic and unsettling atmosphere. The cottage is bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun, but the overall feeling is one of impending danger. She clutches her shawl tightly around her, and her eyes are filled with a mixture of fear and determination. The watercolor technique emphasizes the textures of the stone cottage and the soft light of the fading day, creating a poignant and emotionally charged scene.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-lambikin7.png)
