![A watercolor scene depicting a group of similarly-sized, light brown monkeys with dark eyes, looking frustrated and cold in a rain-soaked mountain environment.  Several shiny, red Gunja fruits are scattered near them. A small yellow bird with detailed feathers is positioned slightly off to the side, looking worried, with its wings slightly spread as if to gesture towards a dark cave mouth in the background.  The color scheme emphasizes the cold greys and blues of the rain and mist, contrasted by the warmth of the red Gunja fruits and the yellow of the bird.

Once upon a time, high in the mountains, lived a group of monkeys. One winter, it rained and rained! The monkeys got very, very cold and wet.

They found some shiny, red Gunja fruits.  They looked like little bits of fire!  The monkeys thought, "Let's blow on them and make a fire to keep warm!"  

A little bird watched from a tree.  He saw the monkeys blowing and blowing.  "Silly monkeys!" he chirped. "Those aren't fire!  Those are fruits! You can't make a fire from them!" 

He flew down and said, "Stop! Find a warm cave or a cozy burrow to hide in!  That's much better than blowing on fruits!" 

An old monkey grumbled, "Mind your own business!" But the bird kept trying to help.

The monkeys were already grumpy and cold. They got even angrier! One monkey grabbed the bird and accidentally hurt him.

The wise old monkeys later learned:  It's best not to give advice unless someone asks for it.
