A Brahmin named Mitra Sharma loved the Fire God.  One rainy day, he wanted to do a special prayer. He needed a goat! 

Mitra went to a friend's house and asked, "Can I please have a goat for my prayer?" His friend gave him a nice, fat goat. Mitra carried the goat home on his shoulders.

Three sneaky people watched him. They were very hungry! They decided to trick Mitra and take his goat.

The first sneaky person stopped Mitra.  "Why are you carrying a dirty dog?" he laughed.

Mitra got mad! "It's a goat! Can't you see?" he shouted.

The sneaky person said, "Okay, okay! Go on." 

The second sneaky person stopped Mitra. "Why are you carrying a dead calf?" he said.

Mitra was even angrier! "It's a GOAT!" he yelled.

The sneaky person said, "Fine, fine! Keep going!" 

The third sneaky person stopped Mitra. "Why are you carrying a donkey?" he asked.

Mitra was so confused!  Three people said his goat was a different animal! He thought maybe it was a magic animal that changed shape!  He was scared! He put the goat down and ran home.

The three sneaky people quickly grabbed the goat and ate it all up!

Sometimes, if you hear a lie many times, it might seem like the truth!
