title: "Munni and the Lost Key"
---

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Munni who lived with her family in a small house. Munni loved to explore the forest behind her house. She would often go for walks and collect pretty stones and leaves. But her favorite thing was her treasure box!  It held all her special things.  The box had a tiny golden key to unlock it.

One day, while exploring, Munni realized she had lost her key! She searched everywhere, but couldn't find it. She felt very sad. She thought she would never be able to open her treasure box again.

Feeling disappointed, she decided to go home. On her way, she met a wise old owl. The owl asked her why she looked so sad.

Munni told the owl about her lost key. The owl listened carefully and said, "Don't worry, Munni, I can help!" 


The owl flew with Munni to a small pond in the forest. He told her to look carefully into the water. There, sparkling at the bottom, she saw her key!  Excited, she reached in and got it back.

Munni was so happy! She thanked the owl for helping her. She rushed to her treasure box, opened it with her found key, and smiled at all her treasures.

From that day on, Munni never went exploring without her key. And she always remembered the wise old owl who helped her.  The story teaches us that if we are patient and keep trying, we can solve our problems!
