![A vibrant watercolor illustration of King Brahma-datta, adorned in elaborate regal attire of deep crimson and gold, listening attentively to the wise man, the future Buddha. The Buddha stands beside him in the Benares palace, bathed in the soft, diffused light of a late afternoon. The king appears to be talking excessively, gesturing wildly with his hands, his face flushed with excitement. The wise man maintains a calm, patient demeanor, his eyes downcast and his hands clasped in front of him. The palace interior features intricately carved wooden pillars casting long shadows across the polished stone floor. Tapestries of deep indigo and ochre adorn the walls. The air is thick with the scent of incense. The watercolor style should emphasize soft blending and a natural flow, capturing the rich textures of silk robes and polished surfaces.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-talkative-tortoise0.png)

A long, long time ago, there was a smart man who used to be the future Buddha. He was born into a family that helped the king, whose name was Brahma-datta, in the city of Benares. When the smart man grew up, he gave the king advice about everything, like what to do and how to be good.


Now, this king loved to talk! He would talk and talk, and no one else could get a word in. The smart man wanted to help the king stop talking so much, so he was always looking for a way to do it.

At the same time, in a pond high up in the mountains, lived a turtle. Two friendly ducks, called hamsas, would fly down to the pond to eat. They became good friends with the turtle. One day, after they knew each other really well, the ducks said to the turtle:

"Hey turtle! Where we live, near the Golden Cave on Mount Beautiful, is an amazing place! Would you like to come with us?"

"But how can I get there?" asked the turtle.

"We can take you," said the ducks, "but you have to promise to keep your mouth shut and not say a word to anyone!"

"Oh, I can do that! Take me with you!" said the turtle.

"Great!" said the ducks. They found a stick, and the turtle bit down on the middle of it. Then, the ducks each grabbed an end of the stick with their beaks, and they flew up into the sky!

They are carrying a turtle, its shell patterned with earthy browns and greens, suspended between them on a sturdy wooden stick. The stick is secured with woven rope. They are flying high above a lush, green landscape with rolling hills and a winding river. A small, idyllic village with thatched roofs and smoking chimneys is visible below, nestled among the trees. The watercolor palette emphasizes vibrant greens and blues for the landscape, contrasting with the crisp whites of the birds and the warm browns of the turtle. Use layered washes to convey the depth and vastness of the sky.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-talkative-tortoise1.png)

As they flew over a village, some people looked up and shouted, "Look! Two ducks are carrying a turtle on a stick!"

The turtle really, really wanted to shout back, "Well, if my friends want to carry me, what's it to you, you silly people!" But just as the ducks were flying over the king's palace in Benares, the turtle let go of the stick to shout. He fell down, down, down into the courtyard and SPLAT! He broke into two pieces!

![A dramatic watercolor illustration depicting the turtle plummeting downwards from the sky, its limbs flailing in desperation. The light catches the rough texture of its shell as it tumbles. Below, the Benares palace courtyard is visible, rendered in warm earth tones with accents of gold and crimson. Tiny figures of people, dressed in brightly colored robes, are looking up in alarm, their faces etched with expressions of shock and fear. The perspective should be dramatic, emphasizing the height and speed of the fall. Add streaks of rain to enhance the sense of impending doom. Use a splattering technique to create a sense of chaotic movement as the turtle falls. Soften edges to convey motion blur.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-talkative-tortoise2.png)

Everyone cried out, "A turtle fell into the courtyard, and it's broken in two!"

The king, with the smart man beside him, went to see what had happened. All the king's helpers came too. The king looked at the turtle and asked the smart man, "Teacher! How did this happen?"

![A somber watercolor illustration of the broken turtle lying in two pieces in the Benares palace courtyard. The fractured shell reveals the raw, vulnerable underside. King Brahma-datta and the wise man (future Buddha) stand nearby, examining the scene with concerned expressions. The king's regal attire is now rumpled and dusty, his face creased with regret. The wise man maintains a calm composure, but his eyes reflect a hint of sadness. Courtiers surround them, their faces a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. The courtyard is paved with uneven stones, stained with water from a recent rain shower. The light is soft and diffused, casting long, mournful shadows. Emphasize the textures of the broken shell and the rough stones using dry brush techniques and layered washes.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-talkative-tortoise3.png)

The smart man thought to himself, "I've been waiting a long time to help the king talk less. This turtle must have made friends with the ducks, and they tried to take him to the mountains. But because he can't stop himself from talking, he must have let go of the stick. That's why he fell and died!"

Then, the smart man said to the king, "Your Majesty, those who talk too much always get into trouble, just like this turtle!"

Then he said these rhyming words:

    "The turtle talked and that was bad,
    He should have kept his mouth shut, sad!
    He held the stick with all his might,
    But talking made him lose his flight.

    So listen close, O King so grand!
    Use wise words, understand?
    The turtle talked and fell down hard,
    A lesson learned in your courtyard!"

The king knew the smart man was talking about him! He asked, "Teacher, are you talking about me?"

![A contemplative watercolor illustration of the wise man, the future Buddha, gesturing with his hand as he speaks to King Brahma-datta. Sunlight streams through a palace window, illuminating the Buddha's serene face and casting a warm glow on his simple robes. The king is listening intently, his hand resting on his chin in a thoughtful gesture. His opulent attire is slightly subdued, reflecting a shift in his character. The broken turtle is subtly visible in the background, partially obscured by a column, serving as a visual reminder of the consequences of recklessness. The walls are adorned with faded frescoes depicting scenes of moral tales. The watercolor style should emphasize soft blending and subtle color variations to create a peaceful and reflective atmosphere.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-talkative-tortoise4.png)

The smart man said, "Great King! It could be you, or anyone else, but whoever talks too much will have bad luck, just like the turtle!"

After that, the king tried hard to talk less, and he became a man of few words. He learned that sometimes, it's better to listen than to talk!

![A subdued watercolor illustration showing the king, Brahma-datta, now listening quietly with his hand on his chin in thought, as his advisors speak. The scene is lit by flickering candlelight, casting dancing shadows across the room. He has fewer luxurious clothes on – a simple tunic of muted blue – but still retains a royal bearing. His face is etched with lines of worry and contemplation. His advisors, dressed in simple robes of brown and grey, are animatedly discussing matters of state. A heavy wooden table is cluttered with scrolls and documents. The room is sparsely furnished, with a rough blanket draped over a wooden stool. The color palette is muted and earthy, reflecting the king's newfound humility and the somber atmosphere of the palace. Use a textured brush to create the illusion of rough hewn walls and worn furnishings.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-talkative-tortoise5.png)
