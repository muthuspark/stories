![Watercolor illustration of a dramatic moment:  An owl, large and imposing in dark browns and grays, sits on a throne constructed from 108 stylized roots, looking disappointed.  Surrounding him are various smaller birds, some flying away, others looking dejected. A crow, small but bold in stark black, stands to the side, slightly away from the action, conveying regret. The color palette uses muted greens and blues for the background and brighter colors for the birds, but maintains a somber overall tone.  The style is detailed and expressive, focusing on conveying emotion through the birds' postures and expressions.](/images/image_panchatantra-crows-and-owls1.png)

Once upon a time, all the birds decided to have a big meeting!  Swans, cranes, parrots, cuckoos, owls, peacocks, doves – so many birds! They needed to talk about something very important.

They waited and waited, but one bird was missing: the crow.  But they couldn't wait any longer!

"Garuda, the king of all birds, is always busy," they chirped.  "He doesn't have time for us! We need a king who will protect us!"

So the birds decided to choose a new king.  They looked at each other.  Then, everyone looked at the owl! He was strong, looked impressive, and could see in the dark – when birds are most scared.

"The owl will be our king!" they all shouted.  They got ready for a big party!

They found 108 special roots and water from a magical river. They made a beautiful throne and even put a tiger skin on the ground!  They invited special people to sing and chant, and the birds beat drums and blew horns.

Just as they were about to crown the owl, a crow arrived!  "What's all this?" he squawked.

The birds explained that they were choosing a new king because Garuda was too busy.  They asked the crow what he thought.

The crow smiled.  "I don't think the owl should be king!" he said.  "He can't see during the day. And he's not very pretty!  We have so many beautiful birds.  And what good is a new king? Garuda's name keeps our enemies away!" 

The other birds thought about what the crow said.  "He's right!" they chirped.  One by one, they flew away. The party was over!

The owl and his wife were left alone.  "What happened?" the owl asked.

His wife said, "The crow made everyone leave!" The owl was very angry.  "That crow is mean! We'll be enemies forever!" he cried.

The crow flew away, feeling sad.  "Why did I say all that?" he thought.  "Now owls and crows will always be enemies!" 

Sometimes, it's better to keep your thoughts to yourself!
