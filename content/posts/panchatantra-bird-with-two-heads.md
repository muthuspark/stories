Once upon a time, near a sparkly lake, lived a big bird named Bharunda.  Bharunda was special â€“ he had TWO heads and TWO necks on one body!

One day, Bharunda found a yummy, shiny red-gold fruit.  One head said, "Wow! This fruit is the best! It's just for me!"  And he gobbled it all up, saying how delicious it was.

The other head asked politely, "Please, can I have a bite?" 

But the first head was greedy. He laughed, "We share a tummy! It doesn't matter who eats it. I found it, so it's all mine!"  The second head felt sad.

A few days later, the second head found some fruit from a poisonous plant.  He said to the first head, "You were mean! Now, I'll eat this fruit and get even!" 

The first head cried, "No! Don't eat it! It's poison! We'll both get sick!" 

But the second head was still angry.  He said, "I found it, so I'll eat it!" and ate the poisonous fruit.

Uh oh!  The poison made Bharunda very, very sick because they shared a tummy!  

The story shows us:  Sharing is caring!  It's better to be kind and work together.
