![Watercolor painting of a single scene depicting Yudhisthira, a kind-faced man with a prominent forehead scar (rendered in a warm, earthy brown), in the center.  On one side, show a group of soldiers in muted greens and blues, looking jealously at Yudhisthira. On the other side, a regal King, depicted in rich purples and golds, is looking at Yudhisthira with a mix of surprise and slight embarrassment.  In the background, faintly depict broken pottery pieces in warm browns and oranges, suggesting Yudhisthira's humble beginnings as a potter, and a faint suggestion of a battlefield in muted grays and browns. The overall style should be gentle and slightly melancholic, emphasizing Yudhisthira's inherent goodness and the irony of the situation.](/images/image_panchatantra-story-of-potter0.png)



Once upon a time, there was a poor potter named Yudhisthira.  He was a kind man, but one night, after drinking too much, he tripped and fell!  He cut his forehead on a broken pot.  Because he was poor, he didn't have any medicine, and the cut left a big scar.

A long time later, there was a big famine. Yudhisthira left home to find food. He joined a group of people who worked for the king.

The king saw Yudhisthira's scar and thought, "Wow, that's a brave warrior!" He made Yudhisthira a soldier!

The other soldiers were jealous. They knew Yudhisthira wasn't a real warrior.  Soon, there was a big battle. Yudhisthira was scared!

The king talked to Yudhisthira and asked about his scar. Yudhisthira told the truth â€“ it was from falling on some pots!


The king was embarrassed. He told Yudhisthira, "You're not a warrior!  Go home!" Yudhisthira asked to stay, but the king said it was too dangerous.  So, Yudhisthira went back to being a potter.


![Watercolor painting showing Yudhisthira (consistent warm skin tones and a prominent brown scar) returning to his pottery wheel.  The scene is peaceful, with soft, muted colors.  In the background, a faint, almost ghostly image of the King and the soldiers can be seen, representing the past event.  The focus should be on Yudhisthira's contented expression as he returns to his craft.  The pottery wheel and surrounding clay should be in earthy tones, contrasting with the slightly desaturated colors used for the background figures. The overall mood should be one of quiet acceptance and self-discovery.](/images/image_panchatantra-story-of-potter2.png)

The story teaches us: It's always better to be yourself!
