![Watercolor painting of two small, brown sparrows with bright eyes in a meticulously detailed, cozy nest high in the lush green canopy of a jungle tree.  A large, grumpy-looking brown monkey with soaking wet fur is huddled beneath the tree, looking up at the nest. The rain is suggested by dark, blurred washes of blue and grey around the monkey and tree. The scene is focused on the contrast between the sparrows' safe, warm nest and the monkey's drenched misery.](/images/image_panchatantra-sparrow-came-to-grief0.png)

Two little sparrows lived in a cozy nest high up in a big tree in the jungle.  They built it themselves and it kept them warm and dry. 

One day, it rained and rained.  A shivering monkey got all wet under the tree.  

"Poor monkey," said the mama sparrow. "Why don't you build your own home? You have hands like us!" 

The grumpy monkey didn't want advice.  "Leave me alone!" he grumbled.

But the mama sparrow kept talking about how nice her nest was.  The monkey got angrier and angrier.  

"She thinks she's so smart!" he thought. He was so mad, he climbed up and ripped the sparrow's nest apart!

The story teaches us: Only give advice to people who want it.  Otherwise, you might get into trouble!
