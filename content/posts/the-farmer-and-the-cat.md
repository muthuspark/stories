title: "The Farmer and the Cat"
---

Once upon a time, there was a farmer who had five buffaloes and a cow. He took very good care of them. He would bring them fresh, green grass from far away and feed them. The buffaloes and the cow were happy with the farmer's care.

Lush green grass surrounds them.  In the background, a small village is visible, painted in muted earth tones.  The style should be reminiscent of children's book illustration, with soft outlines and gentle color blending.  A small, mischievous orange cat is subtly lurking near a pail of overflowing milk in the foreground.](/images/image_the-farmer-and-the-cat00.png)

Every morning and evening, they gave so much milk that the farmer's family had to sell some.  Their milk became famous all over the village!

The farmer was very happy because he was making good money. 

But then, a big cat started visiting the farmer's kitchen.  Every time the farmer left the milk, the cat would drink some and make a mess! The farmer tried to chase it away many times, but the clever cat would quickly climb the walls and run away.


One day, the farmer decided to teach the cat a lesson. He made a trap using a jute bag.  The cat easily fell into the trap.

The farmer first wanted to hit the cat with a stick, but the cat was scratching and clawing so much that he couldn't get close.

The cat is depicted in shades of orange and white, its fur slightly ruffled, showing its agitation.  The jute bag is a rough, textured brown.  The overall color palette is warmer, with hints of orange and yellow to foreshadow the impending fire.  The scene should be slightly chaotic, hinting at the farmer's rising anger.](/images/image_the-farmer-and-the-cat1.png)

But he was determined to teach the cat a lesson! He lit a matchstick and threw it into the bag.  The bag caught fire! The scared cat ran to escape the flames, with the burning bag following it.

The cat ran and ran, spreading the fire throughout the whole village!  People shouted, "Fire! Fire! Put it out!"  The cat had accidentally started a huge fire that burned down many houses, including the farmer's!

The farmer sat down, very sad. He was very sorry for what he had done.  He realized it was his anger that had caused all this trouble.  It was too late to undo what had happened.

The fire is painted with vibrant reds and oranges, contrasting with the ash-gray surroundings.  The orange cat, now slightly singed and appearing remorseful, is shown running away from the flames.  The five buffaloes and the cow are safely tucked away in a distance, painted in the same consistent color scheme as before. The overall mood is somber and reflective.](/images/image_the-farmer-and-the-cat2.png)

**Lesson:**  We should never act in anger.  If we do, we might hurt ourselves and others.
