Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived three little pigs. Their mother was no longer with them.  The three brothers lived together in a small space.

As they grew bigger, their little home became too small.  So, each of the three little pigs decided to build their own house.

The first pig didn't work very hard and built his house out of straw. The second pig worked a little harder and built his house out of sticks.

The third pig thought carefully and, after working very hard, successfully built a house of bricks.

Now, all three were happily living in their own houses. Some time passed, and one day, a big, bad wolf attacked the three little pigs' houses.

The first two little pigs' houses (made of straw and sticks) were easily blown down by the wolf's huff and puff! The wolf gobbled up both the little pigs.

After a while, he huffed and puffed again, but he couldn't blow down the third little pig's house. The little pig was safe inside! The wolf tried very hard to break the house, but he couldn't.  The third pig's house was very strong because he had worked so hard to build it.

Soon, the big, bad wolf took a deep breath and ran away.

**The Moral of the Story:** Hard work always pays off. Think about the future instead of taking shortcuts, and don't be lazy!
