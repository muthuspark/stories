Kamatura, an old merchant with pale skin and grey hair, wearing a luxurious robe in deep purples and golds, is embraced by his young wife, her dark hair framing her face, clad in a bright pink garment.  A shadowy figure of a thief is partially visible in the background, suggesting a sense of danger that has unexpectedly brought the couple closer.

Once upon a time, there was a rich, old merchant named Kamatura.  He was very sad because his wife had died, and he wanted to get married again.

He gave a lot of money to another merchant to marry his young daughter.  But the young wife wasn't happy! She didn't like her old husband at all. She wouldn't even look at him.

The old merchant was sad, but he tried very hard to make his wife happy.

One night, a thief snuck into their house! The young wife woke up and heard the thief. She was scared!  She quickly hugged her husband really tight to feel safe, without making a sound.

The old merchant woke up feeling his wife's hug. He was surprised! He thought, "Wow, she's hugging me! Why?"

Then he saw the thief! He understood. His wife had hugged him because she was scared.

He shouted to the thief, "Thank you! My wife never hugs me, but now she does because of you!  Please take whatever you want!" 

The old merchant was very happy. Sometimes, even something bad can lead to something good!
