![Watercolor painting of a kind Brahmin and his wife, Shandili, in warm earth tones. Shandili, in a reddish-brown sari, is tending to a small pile of sesame seeds near a sun-drenched house with a terracotta roof. A mischievous-looking dog with dark brown fur is nearby, its tail wagging, near scattered sesame seeds.  The Brahmin, in a similar shade of brown but a slightly lighter dhoti, is depicted walking away from the house towards a distant city visible on the horizon, small and hazy, suggesting his journey to procure food. The overall style should be reminiscent of traditional Indian miniature painting with a soft, watercolor wash.](/images/image_panchatantra-shandili-and-sesame-seeds0.png)




Once upon a time, a kind Brahmin and his wife, Shandili, lived near a city. They were happy but didn't have much money.

One day, the Brahmin said, "Tomorrow's a special festival!  Let's give some food to a hungry person. I'll go to the city and get some extra food. You should also invite a Brahmin for a meal and give them some clothes."

Shandili worried, "But we're poor! We don't have extra food or clothes!" 

The Brahmin said, "Even if we only have a little, we should share it." 

Shandili agreed. "I have some sesame seeds," she said. "I'll clean them and make a tasty dish."

The next morning, the Brahmin went to the city. Shandili cleaned the sesame seeds, dried them in the sun, and did her chores.

A naughty dog came and messed up the sesame seeds!  Shandili was sad.  She thought, "I'll trick my neighbor! I'll trade my clean sesame seeds for her dirty ones. She'll be happy because cleaning them takes a long time."

Shandili went to her neighbor and offered the trade.  The neighbor was excited! But then, her son said, "Mom, that's too good to be true! Don't trade!" 

The neighbor listened to her son and didn't trade. Shandili went home.

Shandili, in a reddish-brown sari, is shown in two instances within a single painting; one on the left, with slumped shoulders near the scattered sesame seeds looking dejected, and one on the right, walking back home with her bowl of sesame seeds intact, a hint of relief on her face. The color palette should be warm and earthy, using variations of browns, oranges and yellows, with a muted background suggesting a simple, rural setting. The overall feeling should be one of quiet reflection and learning.](/images/image_panchatantra-shandili-and-sesame-seeds2.png)

The story teaches us: When something sounds too good to be true, think carefully before you do it!
