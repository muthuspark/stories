![Watercolor illustration of a frustrated tiger trapped in a rusty, barred cage. The time is early morning; sunlight filters through the jungle canopy, casting dappled shadows on the cage floor. The tiger, an orange blaze against the dark iron, is snarling, its black stripes rippling with tension as it claws at the rust-covered bars. Its eyes burn with rage. Brahman, a kind-looking man with simple, earth-toned clothing – a faded dhoti and shawl – stands outside the cage, looking concerned, his brow furrowed with worry. His hands are clasped nervously. Lush green jungle foliage, with vibrant emerald greens and deep shadows, surrounds them. Vines creep up the cage bars. The air is thick with humidity, hinted at by a slight shimmer in the distance. Artistic style: Soft, natural watercolor with flowing washes and delicate details, emphasizing the contrast between the raw power of the tiger and Brahman's gentle nature.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal0.png)

Once upon a time, there was a tiger who got stuck in a trap. He tried and tried to get out, but he couldn't. He was so angry and sad that he rolled around and tried to bite the bars of the trap.


Just then, a kind man named Brahman walked by. "Please, let me out of this cage!" the tiger shouted.

"Oh, no, my friend," Brahman said gently. "If I let you out, you might eat me!"

"No, I wouldn't!" the tiger promised, crossing his paws. "I would be so grateful! I would be your helper forever!"

The tiger cried and sobbed and made such a fuss that Brahman felt sorry for him. Finally, he agreed to open the door of the cage. Zoom! The tiger jumped out and grabbed Brahman. "Ha! You're so silly!" the tiger said. "Now I'm going to eat you! I'm super hungry after being stuck in that cage for so long!"

![Watercolor illustration of the tiger, now free from the cage, towering over the much smaller Brahman, who is on his knees begging. It's high noon; the sun beats down harshly, creating stark, unflattering shadows. The tiger has a predatory grin, its sharp claws extended, glinting in the sunlight. Its fur is detailed with individual brushstrokes, highlighting its muscular build. Brahman is on his knees, his face etched with terror, hands clasped in supplication. He's covered in dust and sweat. The open cage sits behind them, casting a long, ominous shadow on the ground. The cage door is slightly ajar, revealing the dark interior. Dry, cracked earth stretches towards the horizon. A hawk circles lazily overhead. Color palette: warm browns, oranges, and yellows for the dry landscape, contrasted with the dark, imposing presence of the tiger. Artistic style: Bold watercolor strokes, emphasizing the drama and tension of the scene, with particular attention paid to the light and shadow.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal1.png)

Brahman begged the tiger to let him go, but the tiger wouldn't listen. Finally, the tiger said, "Okay, I'll let you ask three things what they think. If they say I'm wrong to eat you, then I won't."

So, first, Brahman asked a big, shady tree what it thought. The tree said, "Why are you complaining? I give shade to everyone who walks by, and they break off my branches to feed their animals. Stop whining and be brave!"

![Watercolor illustration of Brahman talking to a large, ancient tree with thick roots. The setting is twilight; the sky is a blend of deep blues, purples, and oranges. The tree, a banyan, has a face etched into its bark, its expression stern and disapproving, the deep wrinkles around its eyes suggesting immense age and wisdom. Moss clings to its bark, adding texture and depth. Brahman appears dejected, with slumped shoulders and downcast eyes. He's leaning against the tree, his shadow stretching long and thin. The air is cool and still. Fireflies flicker in the background, adding a touch of magic. Color palette: muted greens and browns for the tree, offset by the vibrant colors of the twilight sky, creating a melancholic mood. Artistic style: Soft watercolor washes to create a sense of depth and atmosphere, with delicate details in the bark and leaves of the tree.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal2.png)

Brahman felt sad and walked on until he saw a buffalo going around and around in a circle, pulling water from a well. He asked the buffalo what it thought, but the buffalo said, "You're silly to expect thank yous! Look at me! When I gave milk, they fed me yummy food, but now that I don't, they make me work hard and give me yucky food!"

![Watercolor illustration of Brahman speaking to a buffalo tied to a water well, walking in endless circles. The time is mid-afternoon; the sun blazes relentlessly, casting short, harsh shadows. The landscape is dry and dusty, with cracked earth and withered vegetation. The buffalo looks weary and resigned, its ribs showing through its thin hide. Flies buzz around its head. The water well is old and crumbling, with a rusty crank and a chipped bucket. Brahman kneels beside the buffalo, speaking softly, his face filled with compassion. He offers the buffalo a handful of dried grass. Color palette: predominantly earthy tones – browns, ochres, and yellows – to convey the aridity of the landscape, with a hint of blue in the distant sky. Artistic style: loose watercolor strokes to capture the texture of the dry earth and the weary state of the buffalo, with a focus on capturing the emotional connection between Brahman and the animal.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal3.png)

Brahman was even sadder. He asked the road what it thought.

"My dear man," said the road, "You're so silly to think things would be different! Everyone uses me, but they just walk all over me and give me nothing but trash!"

Brahman turned around, feeling very gloomy. On his way back, he saw a jackal, who called out, "Hey, Mr. Brahman! What's wrong? You look as sad as a fish out of water!"

Brahman told him everything that had happened. "Wow, that's confusing!" said the jackal. "Can you tell me the story again? It's all mixed up in my brain!"

Brahman told the story again, but the jackal shook his head and still didn't understand.

"This is strange," he said sadly. "It's like the story goes in one ear and out the other! I need to go to the place where it happened. Maybe then I can understand."

So, they went back to the cage. The tiger was waiting for Brahman, sharpening his teeth and claws.

![Watercolor illustration of Brahman and a clever-looking jackal standing near the cage. The tiger is visible inside, pacing restlessly. It's late afternoon; the light is warm and golden, casting long shadows. The jackal is scratching its head with its hind paw, appearing confused, its brow furrowed. Its fur is a mix of browns and greys, realistically rendered with individual brushstrokes. Brahman looks hopeful, his eyes fixed on the jackal, his hands clasped in anticipation. The cage is bathed in the warm light, highlighting the tiger's frustrated movements. Scattered leaves and twigs litter the ground. A distant temple silhouette is visible on the horizon. Color palette: warm golds and browns to create a sense of hope and anticipation, contrasted with the darker tones of the cage and the frustrated tiger. Artistic style: detailed watercolor painting, focusing on the textures of the fur and the metal of the cage, with soft blending to create a realistic and engaging scene.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal4.png)

"You took a long time!" the tiger growled. "Now, let's start our dinner!"

*Our* dinner! thought Brahman, his knees shaking with fear. *That's not very nice!*

"Please, Mr. Tiger!" he begged. "Give me five minutes to explain to the jackal. He's a little slow."

The tiger agreed, and Brahman told the whole story again, making it as long as possible.

"Oh, my poor brain! My poor brain!" cried the jackal, wringing his paws. "Let me see... how did it start? You were in the cage, and the tiger walked by..."

"No!" the tiger interrupted. "You silly thing! *I* was in the cage!"

"Oh, right!" cried the jackal, pretending to be scared. "Yes, I was in the cage... no, I wasn't! Oh dear! Where's my brain? Let me see... the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage walked by... no, that's not it! Never mind me, just start your dinner! I'll never understand!"

"Yes, you will!" the tiger shouted, angry at the jackal's silliness. "I'll *make* you understand! Look! *I* am the tiger!"

"Yes, Mr. Tiger!"

"And *that* is the Brahman!"

"Yes, Mr. Tiger!"

"And *that* is the cage!"

"Yes, Mr. Tiger!"

"And *I* was in the cage! Do you understand?"

"Yes... no... please, Mr. Tiger..."

"Well?" the tiger said impatiently.

"Please, Mr. Tiger! How did you get in?"

"How? In the usual way, of course!"

"Oh dear! My head is spinning again! Please don't be mad, Mr. Tiger, but what is the usual way?"

The tiger got very angry. He jumped into the cage and shouted, "This way! Now do you understand?"

![Watercolor illustration of the tiger demonstrating how he got into the cage. He is crouched inside, looking triumphant and annoyed. It's early evening; the light is fading, casting long, dramatic shadows. The tiger's eyes gleam in the dim light. His fur is ruffled, and his posture is tense. The jackal watches from outside with a sly grin, one paw reaching tentatively for the cage door latch. Its tail twitches with amusement. The cage is dimly lit, the bars casting intricate shadows on the ground. The surrounding jungle is dark and mysterious. The air is filled with the sounds of crickets and other nocturnal creatures. Color palette: muted greens, browns, and greys to create a sense of suspense and anticipation, with highlights on the tiger's eyes and the jackal's grin. Artistic style: Loose, expressive watercolor strokes to capture the movement and emotion of the scene, with emphasis on the contrast between light and shadow.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal5.png)

"Perfectly!" grinned the jackal. He quickly shut the door and said, "And if you don't mind me saying so, I think things will stay just like this!"

![Watercolor illustration of the jackal grinning as it latches the cage door, trapping the tiger once again. Brahman stands beside the jackal, looking relieved and grateful. The tiger is roaring in frustration from inside the cage, its orange fur a blur of motion. The scene is moonlit; the sky is a deep indigo, dotted with stars. The jackal's grin is wide and mischievous. Its fur is illuminated by the moonlight. Brahman bows his head in gratitude, his hands folded in prayer. The cage door clicks shut with a satisfying thud. The sound echoes through the silent jungle. Color palette: cool blues and greens for the moonlight and the surrounding jungle, contrasted with the warm oranges and reds of the tiger's frustration. Artistic style: delicate watercolor washes to create a sense of atmosphere and magic, with sharp details in the jackal's grin and the tiger's expression of rage. The moonlight creates a soft, ethereal glow.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-tiger-the-brahman-and-the-jackal6.png)
