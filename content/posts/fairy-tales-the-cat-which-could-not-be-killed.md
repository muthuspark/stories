Once upon a time, there were a dog and a cat who were always arguing! The dog would try to hit the cat, but he could never really hurt her. She would just dance around and shout, "You can't hurt me, you can't hurt me! My shoulder was a little sore, but now it feels all better!" 

![A vibrant watercolor illustration of a cartoon dog and cat arguing face-to-face at golden hour. The dog, a large, fluffy golden retriever, looks intensely frustrated with teeth bared, casting a long shadow behind him. The cat, a slightly smaller calico, dances with a mischievous grin, sunlight glinting off her fur, highlighting her vibrant orange and black markings. Splatters of bright orange and yellow paint suggest the setting sun. The background is a slightly blurred, impressionistic rendering of a cozy living room with a worn wooden floor, a plush red rug, and a glimpse of a window showing a fiery sunset. The dog's fur is textured with short, quick brushstrokes, while the cat's fur is smoother with delicate, overlapping washes.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed0.png)

So, the dog went to a bird and said, "What can I do to hurt this cat? I try to hit her and bite her, but it doesn't work! I'm a big dog and she's a pretty big cat, but when I try to hurt her, I can't! But when she scratches me, it really hurts!"

The dog is looking up at the bird with a pleading expression, his brown eyes wide and innocent. Soft morning light filters through the cherry blossoms, creating dappled shadows on the dog's face and the grassy ground. The background shows a slightly blurred park scene with a winding path and distant trees. The color palette is soft pastels – pinks, blues, and greens – evoking a sense of serenity and hope. The branch is rendered with delicate lines, and the bird's feathers have a textured, almost feathery appearance, with slight details of the tree bark and leaves in a watercolor style.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed1.png)

The bird said, "Bite her mouth really, really hard, and that will hurt her!" 

"Oh, no," said the cat, who had just walked up, giggling. "That won't hurt me at all!" The dog bit her mouth as hard as he could. "Nope, that tickles!" said the cat, dancing around.

The scene takes place in a sunny kitchen. Sunlight streams through a window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The bulldog's wrinkly face is comically exaggerated, with slobber droplets rendered as tiny, translucent watercolor splatters. The cat's fur is sleek and smooth, painted with gentle washes of cream and brown. The background features a slightly blurred countertop cluttered with colorful ceramic bowls and a vintage teapot. The color palette is warm and inviting, with hints of red, yellow, and brown. The kitchen floor has a subtle texture suggesting aged linoleum.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed2.png)

So, the dog went back to the bird and said, "What else can I do?" 

"Bite her ears!" said the bird. So, the dog bit the cat's ears, but she danced around and said, "Oh, you didn't hurt me! Now I can wear earrings!" And she put in her earrings.

The dog went to an elephant. "Can you get rid of this cat? She bothers me all the time!" 

"Oh, yes," said the elephant. "Of course, I can! She's tiny, and I'm huge!" Then the elephant picked her up with his trunk and threw her really far! The cat jumped up right away and danced around, saying, "You didn't hurt me even a little bit! My back felt a little funny, but now I feel great!"

The elephant looks determined, its trunk tightly curled around the cat, with small splashes of watercolor suggesting the force being exerted. The cat has a surprised expression, her eyes wide and her fur standing on end. The color palette is bold and vibrant, with the elephant rendered in shades of gray and brown and the cat in warm oranges and browns. The background features a vast savanna, painted in soft washes of yellow and green, with scattered acacia trees casting long, jagged shadows. The rough texture of the elephant's skin is suggested with dry brushstrokes.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed3.png)

The elephant got annoyed and said, "I'll teach you a new kind of dance!" He picked up the cat and put her on the ground and stood on her with his big foot. But she wasn't hurt at all! She danced around and said, "You didn't hurt me, not one bit!" And she dug her claws into the elephant's trunk.

The cat is underneath the elephant's foot, with only the head visible, but looks unharmed and is smiling with an unconcerned expression, seemingly enjoying a head scratch. The elephant's foot is massive and textured, casting a shadow over the cat. The cat's luxurious fur is flattened but perfectly coiffed. The background features a bright, clean kitchen with white cabinets and a stainless steel refrigerator. The floor tiles are a checkerboard pattern of black and white. The color palette is bright and cheerful. The scene has a playful tone, suggesting a bizarre but harmless interaction.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed4.png)

The elephant ran away screaming, and he told the dog, "You need to be careful of that cat! She must be related to tigers!" The dog felt very angry at the cat. "What can I do to get rid of this cat?" he asked himself. And he bit her nose so hard that it started to bleed! But she just laughed at him. "Now I can wear a nose ring!" she said. He got really mad!

"I'll bite her tail in half!" he said. So, he bit her tail in half, but it still didn't hurt her.

The cat is looking back at the severed tail with a nonchalant expression, almost bored, while tiny blood splatters form around the bite. The severed tail lays on the grimy cobblestone alley with a slight curl. Shadows stretch long and distorted. The color palette is muted and gritty, with browns, grays, and greens dominating the scene. The alleyway is filled with overturned trash cans, broken bottles, and discarded newspapers. The cat's fur is matted and dusty. The scene has a dark, surreal quality.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed5.png)

Then he went to a leopard. "If you can get rid of this cat, I'll give you anything you want!" 

"Okay, I'll do it," said the leopard. And they went together to find the cat. 

"Wait," said the cat to the leopard. "I need to talk to you first. I'll give you something yummy to eat, and then I'll tell you what I want to say." And then she ran away really, really far! After she had run for a while, she stopped and danced, calling out, "Ha! I'm not giving you anything to eat! You couldn't catch me anyway!" The leopard went away feeling very grumpy and said, "That cat is super clever!"

![A dynamic watercolor illustration of a cartoon Siamese cat running away from a cartoon leopard through a lush jungle. The leopard is in pursuit, looking angry with bared fangs and a menacing growl. The cat has a triumphant, mocking expression, glancing back over her shoulder. Sunlight filters through the dense foliage, creating dappled shadows on the ground. The color palette is rich and vibrant, with deep greens, browns, and yellows dominating the scene. The jungle is filled with exotic plants and flowers, all rendered in a loose, impressionistic style. The leopard's spots are carefully detailed, while the cat's fur is smooth and sleek. Brushstrokes capture the sense of motion and urgency.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed6.png)

The dog went to a person next and said, "Can you get rid of this cat? She's driving me crazy!" 

"Of course, I can," said the person. "I'll poke her tummy with this knife!" And he poked the cat's tummy with the knife, but the cat just jumped up, and her tummy was all better, and the person went home.

And the dog went to a bear. "Can *you* get rid of this cat? I can't!" 

"I'll get her!" said the bear. So, he stuck all his claws into the cat, but he didn't hurt her! And she stuck her claws into the bear's nose so deep that he fell over right away.

The cat is leaping in the air, retaliating with claws extended toward the bear's nose. Snowflakes swirl around them, creating a hazy atmosphere. The bear looks enraged, its fur bristling. The cat's fur is long and thick, providing some protection from the cold. The background features jagged mountain peaks and a deep blue sky. The color palette is cool and icy, with whites, blues, and grays dominating the scene. The texture of the snow is suggested with splatters of white paint. The entire scene is full of energy and chaos.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed7.png)

Then the poor dog felt very sad and went and jumped into a hole, and he stayed there forever, while the cat went away to find her friends.

![A melancholic watercolor illustration of a cartoon basset hound sadly sitting in a dark hole dug into the earth. The dog looks defeated and dejected, with its head hanging low and droopy eyes. Dim light filters into the hole, illuminating the dog's face. The color palette is muted and somber, with browns, grays, and blues dominating the scene. The walls of the hole are rough and uneven, with exposed roots and dirt. A single, wilted flower lies near the dog's paws. The scene evokes a sense of loneliness and despair. The dog's long, floppy ears hang limply. A small puddle reflects the dim light.](/images/image_fairy-tales-the-cat-which-could-not-be-killed8.png)
