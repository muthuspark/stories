Once upon a time, there was a big jungle.  A river flowed near the jungle. On a berry tree beside the river lived a monkey.

Every day, the monkey ate delicious berries. One day, he saw a crocodile resting under the tree. The crocodile looked tired and hungry. The monkey thought, maybe the crocodile is hungry too! So, he gave some berries to the crocodile.

The crocodile thanked the monkey for the berries. Soon, they became best friends and spent a lot of time together. Now, the monkey gave berries to the crocodile every day. They both enjoyed eating the berries.

One day, the monkey gave the crocodile extra berries for his wife. He wanted them to share the berries. But the monkey didn't know about the crocodile's wife! She was a very naughty crocodile.

When she ate the berries, she got a bad idea. She told her husband, "If these berries are so sweet, then the monkey's heart must be even sweeter! I want to eat his heart!" 

The crocodile was worried at first, but he did what his wife wanted.  They planned to trick the monkey and eat him!

The next day, the crocodile went to his friend. He told the monkey that his wife wanted to meet him because she loved the berries so much.

The monkey and the crocodile started swimming towards the crocodile's house. The crocodile carried the monkey on his back.  As they swam, the crocodile told the monkey about his wife's plan to eat his heart!

The monkey was scared! But he was also very clever. He quickly said, "Oh no! I left my heart on the berry tree. Your wife wants to eat it! I need to go back and get it."

The monkey, in shades of warm brown, is high up on the berry tree, looking down at the crocodile, a dull olive green, who is swimming back towards the shore, looking crestfallen.  The berry tree is detailed, with ripe red berries hanging heavily from its branches. The background shows a blurry, impressionistic watercolor depiction of the jungle and river. The overall palette is warm, but the crocodile is depicted in cooler tones to highlight his loss and regret. Style: expressive, slightly abstract.](/images/image_the-monkey-and-the-crocodile2.png)

The silly crocodile believed him and turned around. As soon as they reached the tree, the monkey quickly climbed up.

From the top of the tree, he shouted, "Does anyone keep their heart on a tree?  No one can live without a heart! You broke my trust by listening to your wife! We can never be friends again!" 

The sad crocodile, having lost his friend, went back to his wicked wife.

**Lesson:** We should choose our friends carefully and not be tricked easily.  Use your brains and be patient when you have problems.  Never trick your friends!
