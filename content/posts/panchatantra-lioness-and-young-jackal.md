![Watercolor painting of a lion family: two adult lions (a tawny-colored mother and a slightly darker father), two lion cubs (smaller versions of their parents), and a smaller, more slender jackal cub (light brownish-grey) all together. The background features lush, green jungle foliage, with hints of sunset colors in the sky.  Focus on the emotional connection between the family members, despite the jackal cub looking slightly apprehensive. The lions should have similar styles of mane and fur rendering to indicate family resemblance.  The scene evokes a sense of warmth and family despite the underlying conflict.](/images/image_panchatantra-lioness-and-young-jackal0.png)



A mommy lion and daddy lion lived in the jungle.  They had two baby lion cubs!  Daddy lion went hunting every day to bring home yummy food for mommy lion and the cubs.

One day, daddy lion couldn't find any food.  It was almost sunset!  Then, he saw a baby jackal.  He felt sorry for the little jackal, so he brought it home instead.


Mommy lion said, "He's just a baby! Let's raise him with our cubs!"  So they did.  They loved all three babies the same.

As the cubs grew, the lion cubs and the jackal cub sometimes fought.  The jackal was different. 

One day, a big elephant came near! The lion cubs wanted to fight, but the jackal wanted to run away. The lion cubs laughed at the jackal and told their parents.

The jackal got really angry. He told mommy lion, "I'm not worse than them! They make fun of me! I'll get revenge!" 

Mommy lion said, "You're right, you're not worse. But you're a jackal, and you act like one. I was kind and raised you, but now you want revenge, you need to leave." 

Mommy lion roared, "Go live with your own jackal family!"  The jackal ran away.

![Watercolor painting depicting the jackal cub running away into the jungle.  The background should be a vibrant jungle scene with dappled light, showing the path of the running jackal.  The jackal cub is smaller and more defined in details than other characters. It's running from the family in the distance, who are shown as silhouettes only. This scene should reflect sadness and a feeling of loneliness for the jackal leaving his adopted family, while also showing the freedom of finding his true self. The color palette should feature muted greens, browns, and darker shades, with hints of orange/yellow in the distant sunset.](/images/image_panchatantra-lioness-and-young-jackal2.png)
