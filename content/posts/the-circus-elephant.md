A long, long time ago, there was a huge circus!  Lots of animals did amazing tricks.  

There was a group of elephants who were super good at their tricks and made everyone happy. 

One day, five elephants performed their tricks.  After their show, they were tied up with weak ropes.  The ropes were so easy to break, but the elephants never tried! 

One day, a man watching the circus asked the ringmaster, "Why don't the elephants break the ropes?" 

The ringmaster explained, "When the elephants were babies, they were tied with thin ropes.  They were too little to break free, no matter how hard they tried. 

Slowly, they stopped trying. They started to believe they couldn't escape.  They were made to believe they weren't strong enough to break the ropes and run away."

So, even when they grew big and strong, they were still tied with easy-to-break ropes.  They never even tried to break free because they believed they couldn't.  They could easily break the ropes in a second, but they didn't! 

**The Lesson:** We should always try to break free from limits and never believe everything we hear. We should always question and try to find out the truth for ourselves.
