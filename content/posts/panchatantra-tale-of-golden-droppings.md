Sindhuka the bird lived high in a big tree on a tall mountain.  Her poo was special – it turned into gold!

One day, a hunter came to the mountain. He couldn't find any animals to hunt, so he rested under Sindhuka's tree.  Plop! Sindhuka pooped, and it landed near the hunter, turning into gold! The hunter was amazed!

He thought, "I've never seen bird poo turn into gold! I have to catch that bird!"  He set a trap, and Sindhuka, who wasn't looking, got caught.

The hunter took Sindhuka home. He thought, "If I keep her, I'll get rich, but people will be suspicious. It's better to give her to the king!" 

So, he went to the palace and gave Sindhuka to the king. The king was so happy! He told his helpers, "Take good care of this bird! Give her lots of food and water!" 

But one smart minister said, "How can bird poo turn into gold? This hunter might be tricking us! Let's free the bird and punish the hunter!" 

The king listened to his minister.  They freed Sindhuka.  Poof! She pooped again, and – guess what? – more gold! The king realized he'd made a mistake, but Sindhuka had flown away!

Sindhuka promised to be more careful, and flew far, far away.  The wise say, 'Always check carefully, even if something seems impossible!'
